Jon said
he was a deserter.

The man who passes
the sentence

116
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,014
should swing the sword.

117
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,418
Is it true he saw
the White Walkers?

118
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,290
The White Walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

119

You will
feed them yourselves.

149

And if they die,
you will bury them yourselves.

What about you?

151
00:17:41,707 --> 00:17:43,308
I'm not a Stark.

You worry too much.

159
00:19:11,428 --> 00:19:14,763

- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads

And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job

175
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,677
You should be

<i>( Thunder rumbles )</i>

180
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,928

00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,780
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

182
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:49,991
All these years

183
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:51,693
and I still feel
like an outsider

184
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:53,962
when I come here.

185
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:56,532
You have five
northern children.

186
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:59,801
You're not an outsider.

187
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,771
I wonder
if the old gods agree.

188
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:06,775
It's your gods
with all the rules.

189
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:14,851
I am so sorry, my love.

190
00:21:16,254 --> 00:21:19,790
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

191
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,361
Jon Arryn is dead.

192
00:21:23,395 --> 00:21:26,064
<i>A fever took him.</i>

193
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,136
<i>I know he was like</i>
<i>a father to you.</i>

194
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:37,208
- <i>Your sister, the boy?</i>
- They both have their health,

195
00:21:37,242 --> 00:21:39,410
<i>gods be good.</i>

196
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:52,056
The raven
brought more news...

197
00:21:53,292 --> 00:21:55,393
The King rides
for Winterfell...

198
00:21:55,428 --> 00:21:57,128
with the Queen

199
00:21:57,163 --> 00:21:59,297
<i>and all the rest</i>
<i>of them.</i>

200
00:21:59,332 --> 00:22:02,601
If he's coming
this far north...

201
00:22:03,971 --> 00:22:06,172
There's only
one thing he's after.

202
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:09,242
You can always say no, Ned.

203
00:22:17,952 --> 00:22:21,689
Catelyn:
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

204
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:23,657
I'm told he reads
all night.

205
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:25,593
I'm told he drinks
all night.

206
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:28,930
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

207
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,731
Stature?

208
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,435
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

209
00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:36,004
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

210
00:22:36,038 --> 00:22:38,707
<i>candles.</i>

211
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:45,882
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?

212
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:48,751
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

213
00:22:48,786 --> 00:22:50,887
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

214
00:22:50,921 --> 00:22:52,955
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab

215
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,557
with his right
royal prick.

216
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:58,460
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.

217
00:22:58,494 --> 00:23:00,963
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

218
00:23:00,997 --> 00:23:03,098
<i>( Laughter )</i>

219
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:40,736
- <i>( Pup barks )</i>
- Gods, but they grow fast.

220
00:23:43,106 --> 00:23:44,573
Brandon!

221
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:47,943
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

222
00:23:47,977 --> 00:23:51,180
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

223
00:23:51,214 --> 00:23:54,082
But he's coming right now--
down our road.

224
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:03,491
I want you
to promise me,

225
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:05,293
no more climbing.

226
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,299
I promise.

227
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,539
- Do you know what?
- What?

228
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:18,874
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

229
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,510
( Chuckles )

230
00:24:21,545 --> 00:24:24,914
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.

231
00:25:09,027 --> 00:25:12,730
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

232
00:25:22,842 --> 00:25:24,476
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

233
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,811
What are you doing
with that on?

234
00:25:29,614 --> 00:25:31,750
- Go on.
- ( Arya groans )

235
00:25:33,052 --> 00:25:34,853
Move!

236
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:54,572
( Neighs )

237
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,868
Your Grace.

238
00:27:02,874 --> 00:27:04,975
You've got fat.

239
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,684
( Laughter )

240
00:27:17,054 --> 00:27:19,689
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

241
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,961
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

242
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:27,896
Guarding the north
for you, your Grace.

243
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:30,700
<i>Winterfell is yours.</i>

244
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,173
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?

245
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:38,909
Robert:
Who have we here?

246
00:27:38,943 --> 00:27:40,711
You must be Robb.

247
00:27:43,382 --> 00:27:47,018
My, you're
a pretty one.

248
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:49,020
Your name is?

249
00:27:49,054 --> 00:27:51,622
Arya.

250
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:54,693
Oh, show us
your muscles.

251
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:57,963
You'll be a soldier.

252
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,369
Arya:
<i>That's Jaime Lannister,</i>
<i>the Queen's twin brother.</i>

253
00:28:03,403 --> 00:28:05,605
Sansa:
<i>Would you please shut up?</i>

254
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:17,249
My Queen.

255
00:28:17,284 --> 00:28:18,918
My Queen.

256
00:28:18,953 --> 00:28:21,154
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

257
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:23,423
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

258
00:28:23,457 --> 00:28:25,158
Surely the dead can wait.

259
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:27,160
Ned.

260
00:28:36,336 --> 00:28:38,137
Where's the imp?

261
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:43,541
Where is our brother?

262
00:28:43,575 --> 00:28:45,776
Go and find
the little beast.

263
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,314
Tell me about
Jon Arryn.

264
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:52,983
One minute
he was fine and then...

265
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,954
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

266
00:28:58,156 --> 00:29:00,091
I loved that man.

267
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,459
We both did.

268
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:04,729
Robert:
He never had to teach
you much, but me?

269
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:05,997
You remember me at 16?

270
00:29:06,031 --> 00:29:07,966
- ( Chuckles )
- All I wanted to do

271
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,635
was crack skulls
and fuck girls.

272
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:13,571
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

273
00:29:13,605 --> 00:29:16,941
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

274
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,214
I need you, Ned--

275
00:29:23,249 --> 00:29:27,152
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

276
00:29:28,688 --> 00:29:31,556
Lord Eddard Stark,

277
00:29:31,591 --> 00:29:34,192
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

278
00:29:38,631 --> 00:29:40,699
I'm not worthy
of the honor.

279
00:29:40,733 --> 00:29:44,470
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

280
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:48,040
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

281
00:29:48,074 --> 00:29:50,175
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

282
00:29:51,444 --> 00:29:53,613
You helped me win
the iron throne,

283
00:29:53,647 --> 00:29:55,748
now help me
keep the damn thing.

284
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:58,784
We were meant
to rule together.

285
00:29:58,818 --> 00:30:02,887
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

286
00:30:02,922 --> 00:30:05,290
Well, it's not too late.

287
00:30:06,692 --> 00:30:08,627
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

288
00:30:10,363 --> 00:30:12,197
We'll join our Houses.

289
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,905
<i>( Woman moaning )</i>

290
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:31,185
( Moaning )

291
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:40,161
- <i>( Cup falls )</i>
- It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

292
00:30:40,196 --> 00:30:42,731
( Giggles )

293
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:50,638
Did you hear the King's
in Winterfell?

294
00:30:50,672 --> 00:30:52,607
I did hear
something about that.

295
00:30:52,641 --> 00:30:54,908
And the Queen
and her twin brother.

296
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:58,078
They say that <i>he</i> is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

297
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:00,246
And the other brother?

298
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,316
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

299
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:06,352
and there's
the clever one.

300
00:31:08,221 --> 00:31:11,257
Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.

301
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:13,359
I hear he hates
that nickname.

302
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:16,629
Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.

303
00:31:16,664 --> 00:31:19,432
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

304
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,902
prone to all manner
of perversions.

305
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:23,837
Clever girl.

306
00:31:25,306 --> 00:31:27,474
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

307
00:31:28,776 --> 00:31:30,677
Have you?

308
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:32,579
- Oh!
- Already?

309
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:37,451
The gods gave me
one blessing.

310
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:39,386
( Door opens )

311
00:31:42,256 --> 00:31:44,858
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.

312
00:31:44,892 --> 00:31:47,227
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

313
00:31:47,261 --> 00:31:50,998
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

314
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:54,668
but our sister craves
your attention.

315
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:56,804
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

316
00:31:56,838 --> 00:31:58,972
A family trait.

317
00:31:59,007 --> 00:32:01,875
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

318
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:04,111
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

319
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:06,514
<i>I'm sorry, I've begun</i>
<i>the feast a bit early.</i>

320
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:09,917
And this is the first
of many courses.

321
00:32:09,951 --> 00:32:12,153
I thought
you might say that.

322
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:14,588
But since
we're short on time...

323
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:16,523
Come on, girls.

324
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,225
( Giggling )

325
00:32:21,595 --> 00:32:23,897
See you at sundown.

326
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:26,499
Tyrion:
<i>Close the door!</i>

327
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,649
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

328
00:32:43,386 --> 00:32:45,687
<i>She should be</i>
<i>on a hill somewhere</i>

329
00:32:45,722 --> 00:32:48,324
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

330
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:50,326
<i>She was my sister.</i>

331
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,128
This is where
she belongs.

332
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:55,698
She belonged with me.

333
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:04,340
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

334
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:08,343
It's done, your Grace.

335
00:33:08,378 --> 00:33:11,013
The Targaryens are gone.

336
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:15,317
Not all of them.

337
00:33:16,819 --> 00:33:18,754
<i>( Gull cawing )</i>

338
00:33:26,095 --> 00:33:28,196
Man:
<i>Daenerys!</i>

339
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:33,134
Daenerys.

340
00:33:33,169 --> 00:33:35,203
There's our bride-to-be.

341
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:39,240
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.

342
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,076
Touch it.

343
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:44,312
Go on,
feel the fabric.

344
00:33:48,951 --> 00:33:51,118
Mmm.

345
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:55,089
Isn't he a gracious host?

346
00:33:57,259 --> 00:33:59,294
We've been his guests
for over a year

347
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,296
and he's never
asked us for anything.

348
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,065
Illyrio's no fool.

349
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,434
He knows I won't
forget my friends

350
00:34:05,468 --> 00:34:07,503
when I come
into my throne.

351
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,308
You still slouch.

352
00:34:17,946 --> 00:34:20,347
Let them see.

353
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,885
You have
a woman's body now.

354
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:30,523
( Sighs )

355
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,405
I need you to be
perfect today.

356
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,708
Can you do that for me?

357
00:34:53,113 --> 00:34:55,815
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

358
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:58,852
No.

359
00:35:05,794 --> 00:35:08,863
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

360
00:35:08,897 --> 00:35:11,131
they will say
it began today.

361
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,523
It's too hot, my lady.

362
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,436
<i>( Gulls cawing )</i>

363
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,512
Where is he?

364
00:35:59,546 --> 00:36:02,180
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

365
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:19,566
( Illyrio speaking Dothraki )
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

366
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,535
May I present
my honored guests?

367
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:25,273
<i>Viserys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen,</i>

368
00:36:25,307 --> 00:36:27,008
<i>the third of his name,</i>

369
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:30,378
<i>the rightful king of the Andals</i>
<i>and the first men,</i>

370
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:32,146
<i>and his sister</i>

371
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:34,816
<i>Daenerys</i>
<i>of House Targaryen.</i>

372
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,686
( Speaking Dothraki )

373
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,188
Do you see
how long his hair is?

374
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:42,924
<i>When Dothraki are</i>
<i>defeated in combat,</i>

375
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:46,894
<i>they cut off their braids</i>
<i>so the whole world can</i>
<i>see their shame.</i>

376
00:36:46,928 --> 00:36:50,897
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

377
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,900
He's a savage, of course,

378
00:36:53,934 --> 00:36:56,269
<i>but one of the finest</i>
<i>killers alive.</i>

379
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:59,672
And you will be his Queen.

380
00:36:59,706 --> 00:37:02,341
Come forward, my dear.

381
00:37:42,415 --> 00:37:44,083
Where is he going?!

382
00:37:44,117 --> 00:37:46,652
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

383
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:49,121
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,

384
00:37:49,156 --> 00:37:51,657
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

385
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,929
It won't be
long now.

386
00:37:56,963 --> 00:37:58,864
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

387
00:37:58,898 --> 00:38:01,333
and take back
your father's throne.

388
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:04,268
The people
drink secret toasts

389
00:38:04,303 --> 00:38:06,003
to your health.

390
00:38:06,037 --> 00:38:08,372
They cry out
for their true king.

391
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,845
When will they
be married?

392
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,416
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

393
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:19,985
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

394
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,089
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.

395
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:24,991
Do you take me
for a fool?

396
00:38:25,025 --> 00:38:26,860
I take you
for a King.

397
00:38:26,894 --> 00:38:30,097
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

398
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,499
My apologies if
I've given offense.

399
00:38:32,533 --> 00:38:34,902
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

400
00:38:34,936 --> 00:38:37,838
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.

401
00:38:37,873 --> 00:38:40,742
I don't want
to be his Queen.

402
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,217
I want to go home.

403
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,585
So do I.

404
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,755
I want us both
to go home,

405
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:55,090
but they took it from us.

406
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,892
So tell me, sweet sister,

407
00:38:56,927 --> 00:38:59,128
how do we go home?

408
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:02,531
I don't know.

409
00:39:02,566 --> 00:39:05,568
We go home with an army.

410
00:39:07,204 --> 00:39:10,406
With Khal Drogo's army.

411
00:39:10,441 --> 00:39:13,443
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--

412
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,680
all 40,000 men
and their horses too

413
00:39:16,714 --> 00:39:18,582
if that's what it took.

414
00:39:25,056 --> 00:39:27,290
( Kisses )

415
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:38,133
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?

416
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:40,702
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?

417
00:39:40,737 --> 00:39:44,407
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

418
00:39:46,743 --> 00:39:49,311
He's so handsome.

419
00:39:49,346 --> 00:39:52,047
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

420
00:39:52,082 --> 00:39:55,184
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

421
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:57,052
Why would he say no?

422
00:39:57,087 --> 00:40:00,356
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

423
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,958
He'd have to leave home.

424
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:05,928
He'd have to leave me.

425
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:08,965
And so would you.

426
00:40:08,999 --> 00:40:11,600
You left your home
to come here.

427
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,436
And I'd be Queen someday.

428
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,073
Please make father
say yes!

429
00:40:17,107 --> 00:40:18,974
- Sansa--
- Please please!

430
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:21,944
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

431
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:28,584
<i>( Music playing,</i>
<i>people chattering )</i>

432
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,156
( Laughter )

433
00:40:35,659 --> 00:40:37,927
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

434
00:40:37,961 --> 00:40:40,229
<i>Come on!</i>

435
00:40:58,715 --> 00:41:01,483
Is he dead yet?

436
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,723
Uncle Benjen.

437
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,525
( Laughs )

438
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,028
You got bigger.

439
00:41:12,063 --> 00:41:15,966
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.

440
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,935
Why aren't you
at the feast?

441
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:21,005
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

442
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,241
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

443
00:41:23,276 --> 00:41:25,978
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

444
00:41:26,012 --> 00:41:28,213
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

445
00:41:28,248 --> 00:41:29,948
So take me with you
when you go back.

446
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:32,851
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.

447
00:41:32,885 --> 00:41:35,086
I know he will.

448
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:39,790
The wall isn't
going anywhere.

449
00:41:39,825 --> 00:41:41,158
I'm ready

450
00:41:41,192 --> 00:41:42,526
to swear your oath.

451
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,262
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

452
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,764
We have no families.

453
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:51,135
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!

454
00:41:52,337 --> 00:41:54,805
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

455
00:41:56,442 --> 00:41:58,076
<i>( Rattles )</i>

456
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:00,345
I'd better get inside,

457
00:42:00,379 --> 00:42:03,048
rescue your father
from his guests.

458
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:08,087
We'll talk later.

459
00:42:15,928 --> 00:42:18,729
Tyrion:
<i>Your Uncle's in</i>
<i>The Night's Watch.</i>

460
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,034
What are you doing
back there?

461
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:27,237
Preparing for a night
with your family.

462
00:42:31,709 --> 00:42:33,810
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

463
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:35,579
You're Tyrion Lannister,

464
00:42:35,613 --> 00:42:37,214
the Queen's brother?

465
00:42:37,248 --> 00:42:39,449
My greatest
accomplishment.

466
00:42:39,484 --> 00:42:43,253
And you-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

467
00:42:46,657 --> 00:42:48,892
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

468
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,463
You are
the bastard though.

469
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,100
<i>Lord Eddard Stark</i>
<i>is my father.</i>

470
00:42:58,469 --> 00:43:00,970
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

471
00:43:01,004 --> 00:43:03,272
making you the bastard.

472
00:43:05,475 --> 00:43:08,277
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

473
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,246
Never forget
what you are.

474
00:43:11,281 --> 00:43:13,215
The rest of the world
will not.

475
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:15,818
Wear it like armor

476
00:43:15,853 --> 00:43:18,388
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

477
00:43:20,024 --> 00:43:23,027
What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?

478
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:27,732
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

479
00:43:43,216 --> 00:43:46,018
( Music playing,
chattering )

480
00:43:49,222 --> 00:43:53,592
You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.

481
00:43:55,428 --> 00:43:57,762
The boy I beheaded--

482
00:43:57,797 --> 00:44:00,365
- did you know him?
- Of course I did.

483
00:44:00,399 --> 00:44:02,501
Just a lad.

484
00:44:02,535 --> 00:44:04,269
And he was tough, Ned,

485
00:44:04,303 --> 00:44:06,071
a true ranger.

486
00:44:06,105 --> 00:44:09,575
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

487
00:44:10,744 --> 00:44:12,979
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.

488
00:44:13,013 --> 00:44:15,581
The two he was with
are still missing.

489
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,419
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

490
00:44:20,453 --> 00:44:22,087
Maybe.

491
00:44:22,121 --> 00:44:25,657
Direwolves
south of the wall,

492
00:44:25,692 --> 00:44:28,193
talk of The Walkers,

493
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:30,829
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

494
00:44:30,863 --> 00:44:34,132
Winter <i>is</i> coming.

495
00:44:35,635 --> 00:44:37,535
Winter is coming.

496
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,037
( Chuckles )

497
00:44:39,071 --> 00:44:42,006
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

498
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,641
- How are you?
- I'm good.

499
00:44:43,675 --> 00:44:46,043
( Laughter )

500
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:49,580
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?

501
00:44:49,615 --> 00:44:52,751
Yes.
Lovely country.

502
00:44:56,457 --> 00:44:59,859
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

503
00:45:01,129 --> 00:45:03,230
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

504
00:45:03,264 --> 00:45:05,499
up here
for the first time.

505
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,369
Hello, little dove.

506
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:12,739
But you are a beauty.

507
00:45:12,773 --> 00:45:14,874
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.

508
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:17,643
You're tall.
Still growing?

509
00:45:17,678 --> 00:45:19,578
I think so, your Grace.

510
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:21,847
And have you bled yet?

511
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,419
No, your Grace.

512
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:31,957
Your dress,
did you make it?

513
00:45:33,259 --> 00:45:36,595
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

514
00:45:38,365 --> 00:45:41,467
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

515
00:45:41,502 --> 00:45:43,737
I hear the same.

516
00:45:43,771 --> 00:45:45,839
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.

517
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,577
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.

518
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,964
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

519
00:46:08,998 --> 00:46:10,665
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

520
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,567
the King has honored me
with his offer.

521
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:14,102
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

522
00:46:14,137 --> 00:46:16,104
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.

523
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:18,341
It would be good
to have you on the field.

524
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,543
The competition
has become a bit stale.

525
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,313
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

526
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:24,848
Getting
a little old for it?

527
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,519
( Chuckles )
I don't fight
in tournaments

528
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:31,054
because when I fight
a man for real

529
00:46:31,089 --> 00:46:33,323
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

530

I belong here with you,

in that rats' nest

541

I <i>won't</i> let him
take you.

542
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:20,202
The king
takes what he wants.

543
00:47:20,236 --> 00:47:22,804
( Huffs )
That's why he's King.

544

"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

547
00:47:31,646 --> 00:47:34,048
He belongs to me now."

548
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:39,754
How did he get so fat?

549
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:42,623
He only stops eating

556
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,521

( Door closes )

558
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,762
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?

559
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:22,431
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

560
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,909
What news?

561
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:37,014
<i>She's fled</i>
<i>the capital.</i>

562
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,819
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.

563
00:48:41,854 --> 00:48:43,822
By the Lannisters.

564
00:48:43,856 --> 00:48:46,625
She says the King
is in danger.

565
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,928
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

566
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:50,963
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

567
00:48:50,997 --> 00:48:53,499
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

568
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:55,701
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

569
00:48:55,735 --> 00:48:58,437
Do you think she would
risk her life--

570
00:48:58,471 --> 00:49:00,105
her son's life--

571
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,609
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

572
00:49:10,752 --> 00:49:12,652
If this news is true

573
00:49:12,686 --> 00:49:15,689
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,

574
00:49:15,723 --> 00:49:19,025
who but you can
protect the King?

575
00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:21,261
They murdered
the last Hand.

576
00:49:21,295 --> 00:49:23,664
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

577
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:25,532
The King rode
for a month

578
00:49:25,567 --> 00:49:27,601
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.

579
00:49:27,635 --> 00:49:30,270
He's the only one
he trusts.

580
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,876
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.

581
00:49:34,910 --> 00:49:38,011
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

582
00:49:38,046 --> 00:49:40,547
He owes him nothing.

583
00:49:42,383 --> 00:49:45,485
Your father and brother
rode south once

584
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,387
on a King's demand.

585
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,391
A different time.

586
00:49:53,827 --> 00:49:55,894
A different King.

When do I meet

592
00:50:58,693 --> 00:51:00,560
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

593
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:03,062
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

594

- you shall have it.
- When?

595
00:51:05,098 --> 00:51:07,199
When their omens
favor war.

596
00:51:07,233 --> 00:51:10,502
I piss on Dothraki omens.

597
00:51:10,537 --> 00:51:13,773
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

A Dothraki wedding

603
00:52:15,137 --> 00:52:18,673

is considered a dull affair.

00:52:41,029 --> 00:52:44,064
A small gift,

songs and histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

609

Are you from my country?

611

Ser Jorah Mormont

thank you

622

There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

623
00:55:24,162 --> 00:55:26,163
Make him happy.

633

from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

634
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:26,050
I didn't pick you
for a hunter.

635
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:29,186
The greatest in the land--
my spear never misses.

636
00:57:30,388 --> 00:57:32,957
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

637

Are you as good
with a spear as you used to be?

638

No, but I'm still
better than you.
