1
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,866
- Whoa.

2
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,332
Whoa.

3
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,979
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

4
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,926
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

5
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,682
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

6
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:31,196
I mean you no harm.

7
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:36,201
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

8
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,200
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

9
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,706
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

10
00:04:41,865 --> 00:04:43,538
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

11
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,532
Might that be you?

12
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,654
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

13
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:51,697
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

14
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,452
- What kinda doctor?
- Dentist.

15
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,428
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

16
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:01,389
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

17
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,134
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

18
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,638
- Speak English.
Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,027
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

20
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,485
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

21
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,059
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

22
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,701
Hello, you poor devils!

23
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,610
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

24
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,080
of the Carrucan plantation?

25
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,045
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

26
00:05:29,663 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

27
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

28
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,666
Django.

29
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,586
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

30
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,692
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

31
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,303
Who are they?

32
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,349
Big John.

33
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:43,495
Ellis.

34
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,819
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

35
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,420
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

36
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:53,660
Not anymore.

37
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,797
Tell me...

38
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,175
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

39
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:04,012
- would you recognize them?
- Hey.

40
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:06,643
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like what?

41
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:08,337
Like that.

42
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,798
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

43
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,020
Speak English, goddamn it.

44
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,924
Everybody calm down.

45
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,822
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

46
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

47
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,154
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

48
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,455
Move it.

49
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:32,541
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

50
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:36,491
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

51
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,448
Last chance, fancy pants.

52
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,221
Oh, very well.

53
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,404
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

54
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,500
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

55
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,950
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

56
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:22,549
You goddamn son of a bitch!

57
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,510
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

58
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,379
And you killed Ace!

59
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:30,223
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

60
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:33,218
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

61
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,358
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

62
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

63
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:42,110
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

64
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,606
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

65
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:53,071
- God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

66
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:56,962
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

67
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,327
Yeah.

68
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,783
Sold American!

69
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,928
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

70
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,833
That iron is nasty business.

71
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:20,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

72
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:23,814
Thank you. Django?

73
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,846
Get up on that horse.

74
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,822
Also, if I were you,

75
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

76
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

77
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:05,610
Goddamn it! Oh!

78
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:12,450
One hundred... ten... 20...

79
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,444
...and five...

80
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,870
...for young Django here.

81
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,195
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

82
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,861
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

83
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,541
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

84
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,303
Do you have one?

85
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,375
- You go to hell, dentist.

86
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,540
I thought not.

87
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,210
No worries. I come prepared.

88
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,152
Thank you.

89
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,894
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

90
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,233
Whoa.

91
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:08,874
Now, as to you poor devils.

92
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:14,095
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

93
00:11:14,257 --> 00:11:17,090
you gentlemen have two choices.

94
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,380
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

95
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:24,480
then carry him to the nearest town.

96
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,226
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

97
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:34,074
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

98
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,784
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

99
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:40,496
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

100
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:42,748
Choice is yours.

101
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:47,280
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

102
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,461
the North Star is that one.

103
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,083
Ta-ta.

104
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:13,992
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

105
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:21,037
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

106
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:25,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

107
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:29,246
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

108
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,385
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

109
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,591
- I'll get you your freedom.

110
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,509
- No. No, please...

111
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,222
All right, now.

112
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:27,379
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

113
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,776
- ...and then in the morning...

114
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,692
That's a nigger on a horse.

115
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,095
What's everybody staring at?

116
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,749
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

117
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,054
Whoa.

118
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,107
Good morning, innkeeper!

119
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,922
Two beers for two weary travelers.

120
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,822
It's still a bit early.

121
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,411
We won't be open for another hour.

122
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,417
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

123
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:45,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

124
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,270
Get that nigger outta here!

125
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:54,812
Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

126
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,140
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

127
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,180
Sheriff! Help!

128
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:01,974
Alas.

129
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,910
Now we must act as our own bartender.

130
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,065
Sit down, my boy.

131
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,631
- What kind of dentist are you?

132
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:28,061
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

133
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:35,982
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

134
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,564
...bounty hunter.

135
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:47,986
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

136
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:49,745
No.

137
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,113
Well...

138
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:56,862
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

139
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,383
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

140
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,761
Hat

141
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,042
Prost.

142
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,898
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

143
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,734
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

144
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,868
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

145
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:27,734
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

146
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,703
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

147
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,572
I truly have killed him,

148
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,746
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

149
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:39,246
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

150
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:41,865
What's a bounty?

151
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,139
It's like a reward.

152
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:50,666
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

153
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,709
Certain people, yeah.

154
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,002
Bad people?

155
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,151
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

156
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,596
Which brings me to you.

157
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,014
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

158
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,603
On one hand, I despise slavery.

159
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:10,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

160
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,440
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

161
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,000
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

162
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,381
work to my benefit.

163
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,205
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

164
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:32,136
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

165
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,015
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

166
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,033
However, at this endeavor,

167
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:52,311
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

168
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,452
But you do. Don't ya?

169
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,836
I know what they look like all right.

170
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,488
Good. So here's my agreement.

171
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:06,090
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin?

172
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,869
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

173
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,208
but I don't know where.

174
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:15,683
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

175
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:21,102
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

176
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:25,511
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

177
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,807
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

178
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:33,705
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

179
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:46,961
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

180
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:54,184
- All right, folks, calm down.

181
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,924
Go about your business.

182
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

183
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:07,474
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

184
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,890
And scare all these nice people.

185
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:14,742
You ain't got nothing better to do

186
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:18,124
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

187
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,535
and show your ass?

188
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:32,790
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?

189
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,444
Now you can get the marshal.

190
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,281
Marshal! Marshal!

191
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,692
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

192
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,064
After you.

193
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:00,739
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

194
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

195
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,115
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

196
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,632
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

197
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,761
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

198
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

199
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,252
You in the saloon!

200
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:21,760
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

201
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,634
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

202
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,967
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

203
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:31,102
and I mean right now.

204
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,656
Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

205
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,616
Yes, it is.

206
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,872
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

207
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,317
Na wunderbar, marshal.

208
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:46,409
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

209
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,492
and just as you have instructed,

210
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,339
I am ready to step outside

211
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:56,597
with my hands raised above my head.

212
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,085
I trust as a representative

213
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:03,627
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

214
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:09,641
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

215
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,643
before I've had my day in court.

216
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,157
You mean like you did our sheriff.

217
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,114
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

218
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,620
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

219
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:25,457
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

220
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:32,031
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

221
00:21:32,208 --> 00:21:35,212
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

222
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:39,223
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

223
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,212
They're a little tense out there.

224
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,844
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

225
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,855
- Come ahead.

226
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:58,151
You unarmed?

227
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,024
Yes, indeed we are.

228
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,112
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

229
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,238
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

230
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,752
as to the incident that just occurred?

231
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,548
- Go on.
- Thank you.

232
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,834
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

233
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,243
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

234
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,845
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

235
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:26,103
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

236
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:30,859
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

237
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,599
with a price on his head of $200.

238
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,739
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

239
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,240
The hell, you say!

240
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:42,438
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

241
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,774
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

242
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,440
sometime in the past two years?

243
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,358
Yeah.

244
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:53,961
I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

245
00:22:54,123 --> 00:22:57,582
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

246
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,540
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

247
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:07,392
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

248
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:09,260
You're encouraged to wire him.

249
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,482
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

250
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,565
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

251
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,749
I'll be damned.

252
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,368
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

253
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:14,071
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

254
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,283
What's your plan after that?

255
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,388
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

256
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:31,502
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

257
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,299
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

258
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,057
Oh, me and my wife do.

259
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:42,403
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

260
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,223
Django.

261
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,484
Django, Django.

262
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,362
You got sand, Django.

263
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,940
Boy's got sand.

264
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,873
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

265
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,075
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

266
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,300
And the girl, too.

267
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:12,213
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

268
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,919
Both of 'em.

269
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:16,838
Separately.

270
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,652
And this one...

271
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:25,980
...you will sell him cheap.

272
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,445
In Greenville...

273
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,959
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

274
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,385
You know when she was sold...

275
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:48,806
...you know where she came from,

276
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,796
and you know her name.

277
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:53,128
What is her name?

278
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,975
Broomhilda.

279
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,798
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

280
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,932
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

281
00:26:04,021 --> 00:26:07,025
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

282
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,311
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

283
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,034
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

284
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,324
She speak a little German, too.

285
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,231
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

286
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,240
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

287
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,003
to speak German with.

288
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,163
Well, let me get this straight.

289
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,930
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

290
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,203
Yep.

291
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:37,001
They call me Hildi.

292
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:59,293
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

293
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,361
You'll be playing a character.

294
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:11,369
Hm?

295
00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:13,500
No?

296
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:24,974
During the act, you can
never break character.

297
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,597
Do you understand?

298
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,904
Yeah. Don't break character.

299
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:37,149
And your character
is that of The Valet.

300
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,408
What that is?

301
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,703
That's a fancy word for servant.

302
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,122
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

303
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:50,128
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

304
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,378
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

305
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:55,504
But of course.

306
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,492
Whoa.

307
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,375
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

308
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,913
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

309
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,970
- I said niggers on horses...
- His name is Django.

310
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:43,935
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

311
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,556
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

312
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:53,222
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

313
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,867
Allow me to unring this bell.

314
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:59,872
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

315
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,158
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

316
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,371
Mr. Bennett?

317
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:11,747
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

318
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,888
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

319
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,969
to parley with you now.

320
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,100
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

321
00:29:24,638 --> 00:29:27,733
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

322
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,689
to buy one of my nigger gals?

323
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,524
No appointment, no nothin?

324
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,610
Oh, I'm afraid so.

325
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,184
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

326
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,031
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

327
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,412
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

328
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,527
Now what you got to say about that?

329
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,790
Mr. Bennett.

330
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,196
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

331
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:56,550
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

332
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:04,216
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

333
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,302
Hm-mm.

334
00:30:18,734 --> 00:30:20,691
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

335
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,410
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

336
00:30:23,572 --> 00:30:25,950
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

337
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:28,278
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

338
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,193
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

339
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,236
What's your Jimmie's name again?

340
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:33,916
- Django.
- Django.

341
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,244
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

342
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,638
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

343
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,082
As you please, Big Daddy.

344
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:45,170
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

345
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:48,678
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

346
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,339
He must be treated
as an extension of myself.

347
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,520
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

348
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

349
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,812
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

350
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,899
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

351
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,952
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

352
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,246
No. That's not what I said.

353
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,961
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

354
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,963
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

355
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,588
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

356
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:26,715
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

357
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,627
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

358
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,307
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

359
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:34,602
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

360
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,738
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

361
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,402
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

362
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,822
That there is the pantry.

363
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:57,488
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

364
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:59,714
Po' little squirrels.

365
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,832
What you do for your massa?

366
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,806
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

367
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,336
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

368
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,854
You mean you wanna dress like that?

369
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:15,150
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

370
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:18,403
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

371
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:20,030
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

372
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,054
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

373
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:26,533
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

374
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,527
I don't know them.

375
00:32:29,114 --> 00:32:30,946
They could be usin' a different name.

376
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,369
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

377
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,152
- You mean the Shaff ers?
- Maybe.

378
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,457
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

379
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:40,364
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

380
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,283
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

381
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,748
Well, one's over in that field.

382
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,445
Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

383
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:01,725
She work in the house, John.

384
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,596
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

385
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,730
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

386
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:07,767
Now, your Bible say...

387
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,527
Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

388
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,317
You ready?

389
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,782
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

390
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,332
it should be me. It should be me, John.

391
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,469
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

392
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,260
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

393
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,963
She's a... she's a house slave.

394
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,565
- She a house slave, she can't be...

395
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,412
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

396
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,462
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

397
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,538
I's on my knees, John.

398
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,673
I like the way you beg, boy.

399
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,983
Is that who you was lookin' for?

400
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,982
Yep.

401
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:25,557
Where the other two at?

402
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,485
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

403
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,324
They whippin' Little Jody?

404
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:33,811
Point me in that direction.

405
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:37,542
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

406
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,257
Go get that white man
I came here with.

407
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,161
- Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

408
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,837
- Come on, girlie.
- Please!

409
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:51,553
- Come on. Get you set up now.

410
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,184
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

411
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,312
- "...and the dread of ye

412
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,757
shall be on every beast
of the earth."'

413
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,434
Come here now, woman!

414
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:05,696
- You'd better give me that arm!

415
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,612
OK, she's ready!

416
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,725
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

417
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,067
John Brittle!

418
00:36:08,625 --> 00:36:11,299
- You remember me?

419
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,600
I like the way you die, boy.

420
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,904
Goddamn son of a bitch!

421
00:36:50,959 --> 00:36:52,427
- Keep it funny!

422
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,454
Y'all wanna see somethin?

423
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,622
No!

424
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:36,289
Who were they?

425
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,009
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

426
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:41,677
Where's Ellis?

427
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:44,187
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

428
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:50,519
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

429
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,608
- Positive?
- I don't know.

430
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:55,024
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

431
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,442
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

432
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,895
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

433
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,716
I'm positive he dead.

434
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,745
Django!

435
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,961
Everybody calm down.

436
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,388
We mean no one else any harm.

437
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,090
Who are you two jokers?

438
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:31,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

439
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,108
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

440
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,867
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

441
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,982
In my pocket is a warrant,

442
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,248
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

443
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

444
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:54,447
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

445
00:38:54,624 --> 00:38:56,718
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

446
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,246
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

447
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,096
These are wanted men.

448
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,727
The law wants 'em for murder.

449
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:10,004
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

450
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,481
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

451
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:17,102
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

452
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:22,600
I realize passions are high,

453
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,816
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

454
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:29,430
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

455
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:33,448
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

456
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:41,202
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

457
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:44,413
Gimme.

458
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,325
Satisfied?

459
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,110
May I have that back, please?

460
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,835
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

461
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,927
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

462
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,275
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

463
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,577
Come on, men!

464
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:41,280
- We're coming for you, nigger!
Hee-haw!

465
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,934
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

466
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,315
That's way too simple for these jokers.

467
00:41:58,057 --> 00:42:00,674
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

468
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:05,904
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

469
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,983
Damn.

470
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,938
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

471
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,153
We ready or what?

472
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,704
Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

473
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:22,249
- Oh... Oh, shit.

474
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:24,634
I just made it worse.

475
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,840
Who made this goddamn shit?

476
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:29,973
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

477
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:33,715
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

478
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,468
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

479
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,310
I coulda cut it better than this!

480
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:41,272
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

481
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,640
Not too good.

482
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:47,145
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

483
00:42:47,315 --> 00:42:50,808
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

484
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,079
- Shit.
- Yeah.

485
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,286
I just made mine worse.

486
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,230
Oh, God.

487
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,944
Anybody bring any extra bags?

488
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,088
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

489
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,862
I'm just askin'.

490
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,838
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

491
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,206
Oh, well, shitfire!

492
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,471
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

493
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,587
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

494
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:15,465
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

495
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:18,047
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

496
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:22,010
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

497
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:24,174
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

498
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:28,107
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

499
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,435
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

500
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

501
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,875
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

502
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,376
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

503
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,381
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

504
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:49,329
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

505
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,623
- Yeah.

506
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:54,724
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

507
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:59,396
So how 'bout no bags this time,

508
00:43:59,554 --> 00:44:04,549
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

509
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,765
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

510
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,228
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

511
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,389
But nobody can see.

512
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,648
So?

513
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:15,684
So it'd be nice to see.

514
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:20,618
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

515
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:26,165
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

516
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,129
Sons of bitches!

517
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,624
I can't see shit!

518
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:35,424
There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

519
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,248
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

520
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,042
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

521
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,630
- What?
- They tricked us!

522
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:42,851
Well, where are they?

523
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,425
Auf Wiedersehen.

524
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,944
Oh!

525
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,153
Bull's-eye.

526
00:44:56,152 --> 00:44:59,452
- Look at 'em run.

527
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,657
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

528
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,784
Goddamn it!

529
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:14,171
Goddamn it!

530
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,506
Would you care to?

531
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,140
Can't see shit outta this!

532
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,931
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

533
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,449
Big Daddy's getting away.

534
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:36,860
I got him.

535
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,171
Got him.

536
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:01,009
The kid's a natural.

537
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:15,475
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

538
00:46:15,648 --> 00:46:17,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

539
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,775
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

540
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

541
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:26,960
Broomhilda is the name of a character

542
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:31,032
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

543
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,162
There's a story about Broomhilda?

544
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,039
Oh, yes, there is.

545
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:44,549
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

546
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

547
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:59,849
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

548
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:05,790
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

549
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,044
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

550
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,454
What she do?

551
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,881
I can't exactly remember.

552
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,714
She disobeys him in some way.

553
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:20,039
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

554
00:47:20,713 --> 00:47:21,828
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

555
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:23,258
It's a German legend,

556
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,223
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

557
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:30,424
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

558
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,185
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

559
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,982
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

560
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:49,569
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

561
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,252
Does a fella arise?

562
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,381
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

563
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,587
A fella named Siegfried.

564
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,292
Does Siegfried save her?

565
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,079
Quite spectacularly so.

566
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:09,251
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

567
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:14,146
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

568
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,800
And he walks through hellfire...

569
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,524
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

570
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:27,326
I know how he feel.

571
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:31,660
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

572
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:41,340
Now, look, Django...

573
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:48,294
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

574
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:53,011
...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

575
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:58,516
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

576
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:01,565
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

577
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:06,687
But let me ask you a question.

578
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,613
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

579
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,466
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

580
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,635
What's not to like?

581
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,205
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

582
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,212
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

583
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,476
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

584
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,591
but normally, that's a good thing.

585
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,606
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

586
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,755
What you mean "partner up"?

587
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:42,234
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

588
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,221
...I give you a third of my bounties.

589
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:50,356
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

590
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,442
I'll take you to Greenville myself

591
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,836
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

592
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,822
Why you care what happen to me?

593
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,542
Why you care if I find my wife?

594
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,089
Frankly...

595
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

596
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:16,272
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

597
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:21,236
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

598
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:26,650
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

599
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:29,432
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

600
00:52:38,739 --> 00:52:39,729
You got her.

601
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:51,465
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

602
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:54,335
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

603
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:56,098
He'll have a loved one with him.

604
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,748
Maybe even share a last word.

605
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,809
That's better than most of them get.

606
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:05,258
Damn sight better than he deserves.

607
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,783
Put down the rifle.

608
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:19,485
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

609
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,624
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

610
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:28,080
Read it aloud.

611
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,754
Consider that today's lesson.

612
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,842
"Wanted. Dead or alive."

613
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:40,711
"Smitty Bacall and the
Smitty Bacall"

614
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,137
- Gang.
- "Gang."

615
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,967
"For murder and stagecoach...

616
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:49,928
...robbery."

617
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,901
- "Seven-zero-zero-zero..."
- Seven thousand.

618
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,406
Thousand.

619
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:58,775
"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."

620
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:04,030
"$1,500 for each of his...

621
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,997
...gang..."

622
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,026
- Mem...
- "Members."

623
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:14,378
"Known members of the Smitty Bacall
Gang are as follas:"

624
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,284
- Follows.
- "Follows."

625
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:20,183
"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and..."

626
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,223
Crazy Craig Koons.

627
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,472
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

628
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,517
If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,

629
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,640
they would never have printed that.

630
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,777
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

631
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,351
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

632
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:42,360
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

633
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,082
This is what I do.

634
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,790
I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.

635
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:53,492
This corpse is worth $7,000.

636
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,884
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

637
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,388
Pa?

638
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,897
Pa!

639
00:55:17,356 --> 00:55:19,063
Here.

640
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:21,327
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

641
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,579
- Why?
- It's good luck.

642
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,536
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

643
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,865
That's accurate.

644
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:27,320
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

645
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:30,524
Who the hell-a you got there?

646
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,654
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

647
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,828
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

648
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:41,076
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

649
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,879
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

650
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:47,423
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

651
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:49,421
and get yourselves some coffee.

652
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,140
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

653
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:53,713
Pretty good.

654
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,211
Move along!

655
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:25,636
Move it, boy!

656
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,422
Keep movin'.

657
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,545
Get on up on that auction block.

658
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:34,470
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

659
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,154
Keep goin'!

660
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:58,528
"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.

661
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:00,113
'r' on right cheek."

662
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,041
Calvin Candie.

663
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:08,633
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.

664
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,138
Candyland?

665
00:59:10,297 --> 00:59:11,378
Oh, so you've heard of it.

666
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,642
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

667
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,474
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

668
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,309
- ...and that's the repellant gentleman

669
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:22,022
who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.

670
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,312
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

671
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:26,469
She... she pretty.

672
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:29,070
And she talk good, too.

673
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,491
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

674
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,815
...burned that runaway "r"
on her cheek...

675
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,412
...they goddamned her.

676
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,498
She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough

677
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,655
for the house no more either.

678
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,119
They gonna try to
make her a comfort girl.

679
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,159
What's a comfort...? Oh.

680
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,374
Not while I got freedom.

681
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,763
Not while I got my gun.

682
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,552
So do we offer to buy her?

683
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:04,560
So...

684
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,817
...say...

685
01:00:09,981 --> 01:00:13,201
...a man wants to buy a horse.

686
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,408
Needs to buy a horse.

687
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,333
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door

688
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,164
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

689
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:23,124
And do you know what the farmer says?

690
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:25,505
The farmer says no.

691
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:31,959
Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealin' that horse.

692
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:36,248
Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

693
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:38,625
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner

694
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,334
because the horse is still his property.

695
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:44,392
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

696
01:00:44,558 --> 01:00:47,158
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

697
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:51,520
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

698
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,192
Go ahead.

699
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,898
So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,

700
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,607
he knocks on the farmer's door...

701
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:05,375
...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

702
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:08,905
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

703
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,881
the farmer is forced to say yes.

704
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,494
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
- No, it's far too big.

705
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,915
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

706
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,433
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

707
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:23,586
What?

708
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:26,596
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

709
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:28,439
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

710
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:29,649
Why?

711
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,441
<i>Because my character is that
of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>

712
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:37,032
<i>here in Greenville to buy my way
into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

713
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:41,108
<i>And your character is a Mandingo expert
I hired to help me do it.</i>

714
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:43,238
<i>They call that "One-Eyed Charley."</i>

715
01:01:46,328 --> 01:01:47,796
Bonjour.

716
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,787
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

717
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,553
<i>Entraz.</i>

718
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,516
- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

719
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:03,167
You want me to play a black slaver?

720
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:06,019
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

721
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,640
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

722
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:12,438
...and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

723
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,554
Then play him that way.

724
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:19,771
Give me your black slaver.

725
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,030
Dr. Schultz!

726
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:36,428
- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.

727
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:39,385
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

728
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:42,346
- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.

729
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:45,342
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

730
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,924
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

731
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:50,772
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

732
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:52,891
Just call me Leo.

733
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:56,224
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

734
01:02:56,398 --> 01:02:58,758
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

735
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:01,327
Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

736
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,284
when we went to
boarding school together.

737
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:06,541
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

738
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:09,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

739
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,610
One could almost say youse a nigger.

740
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:13,908
What did you say?

741
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:16,824
- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

742
01:03:17,377 --> 01:03:21,803
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

743
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:23,956
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

744
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,932
What civilized people aren't?

745
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

746
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:35,146
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

747
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:40,317
Get back on top, now!
Turn around!

748
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,783
There you go.

749
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,908
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

750
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:54,499
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

751
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:57,114
Quit stalling, now.

752
01:03:57,292 --> 01:03:58,635
Answer the question.

753
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,721
The awful truth? I'm bored.

754
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,261
This seems like a good bit of fun.

755
01:04:12,182 --> 01:04:14,173
Well, come on over.

756
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,059
We got us a fight goin' on
that's a good bit of fun.

757
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,575
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

758
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,306
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.

759
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,860
- Dr. Schultz.
- What a rare pleasure.

760
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,375
Keep fighting, niggers.

761
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,348
- And I might add, an honor.
- Honor to meet you.

762
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:51,434
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

763
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:55,089
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

764
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:57,553
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

765
01:05:17,205 --> 01:05:20,243
Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go.

766
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:22,670
He's much bigger and stronger!

767
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,429
Come on, now!

768
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,079
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

769
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,976
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

770
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:37,234
- You either hit him or are you ain't?

771
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:48,328
- Big Fred, come on!

772
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:50,022
Turn him around! Now...

773
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:58,160
Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

774
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:02,046
There you go!

775
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,845
There you go! Look at that.

776
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,891
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

777
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,097
Do what I told you, boy!

778
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:13,728
- There you go!

779
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,174
- No!
- Do what I told ya!

780
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,385
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

781
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,303
- Oh, no, Luigi.

782
01:06:27,525 --> 01:06:31,439
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

783
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,243
Oh...

784
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,077
Finish him.

785
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,121
Go on, boy, finish him!

786
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,344
That's why they
call him Big Fred.

787
01:06:57,514 --> 01:07:00,939
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

788
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,319
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

789
01:07:03,478 --> 01:07:06,482
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

790
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,813
Mercedes.

791
01:07:29,921 --> 01:07:31,127
Tequila.

792
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,642
What's your name?

793
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:46,313
Django.

794
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,404
Can you spell it?

795
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:56,566
D-J-A-N-G-O.

796
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,576
The D is silent.

797
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,335
I know.

798
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:12,787
Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

799
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,671
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

800
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:17,424
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

801
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,394
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

802
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:21,503
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

803
01:08:21,681 --> 01:08:25,561
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

804
01:08:29,397 --> 01:08:32,401
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

805
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,853
Yessir.

806
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:47,158
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

807
01:08:50,710 --> 01:08:52,326
Where'd you dig him up?

808
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:55,746
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

809
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:59,561
I've heard tell about you.

810
01:09:00,303 --> 01:09:03,045
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

811
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,350
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

812
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:09,726
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

813
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:14,101
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

814
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:19,497
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

815
01:09:20,531 --> 01:09:21,874
No offense given...

816
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,906
...none taken.

817
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,784
Monsieur Candie...

818
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:29,446
...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

819
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,092
One...

820
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:34,838
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

821
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,837
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

822
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,839
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

823
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,841
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

824
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,105
Do not spare the rum.

825
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,756
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

826
01:09:47,934 --> 01:09:49,641
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

827
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:54,931
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

828
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,621
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

829
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:02,187
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

830
01:10:02,365 --> 01:10:04,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

831
01:10:04,659 --> 01:10:07,208
at above top-dollar market price.

832
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,919
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

833
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

834
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:17,638
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

835
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:20,141
We were discussin' my curiosity.

836
01:10:22,427 --> 01:10:23,417
Thank you.

837
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,302
Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

838
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:31,766
Sheba... you stay right there.

839
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,472
I know you didn't mean me.

840
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,723
- Prost!
- German.

841
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,440
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

842
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:44,661
I'm doing business with both y'all.

843
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:47,236
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

844
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,165
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

845
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,502
Hm.

846
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:54,781
So...

847
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:56,882
...Bright Boy...

848
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,004
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

849
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,334
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

850
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,009
Not for top dollar.

851
01:11:05,178 --> 01:11:07,226
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

852
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

853
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:11,935
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

854
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,058
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

855
01:11:15,021 --> 01:11:18,184
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

856
01:11:18,357 --> 01:11:22,658
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

857
01:11:24,906 --> 01:11:28,570
Well, you won't sell your best.

858
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,155
You won't even sell your second best.

859
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:34,993
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

860
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:39,080
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

861
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,927
...who knows what could happen?

862
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,545
And what do you consider ridiculous?

863
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:51,649
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

864
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,440
How much would you say, Django?

865
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,522
Twelve thousand dollars.

866
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:09,076
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

867
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,165
but now you have my attention.

868
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:30,519
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

869
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,092
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

870
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:37,180
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

871
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

872
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:41,934
Oh, thank you very much.

873
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

874
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:53,737
Django.

875
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:02,171
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

876
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:07,513
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

877
01:13:07,675 --> 01:13:11,794
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

878
01:13:11,971 --> 01:13:16,636
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

879
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:18,311
The exceptional nigger.

880
01:13:19,312 --> 01:13:21,360
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

881
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,653
Sun is up.

882
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,683
Shining on all of us.

883
01:13:31,449 --> 01:13:34,362
- Have a seat, doc.
- Thank you.

884
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,821
Quite an honor.

885
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:37,702
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

886
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:41,240
<i>But I do believe that,
given time,</i>

887
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,387
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

888
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,170
...become if not frequent...

889
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,040
...more frequent.

890
01:13:51,802 --> 01:13:56,399
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

891
01:13:56,557 --> 01:13:59,436
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

892
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:13,700
- Whoa!

893
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,626
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

894
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:20,711
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

895
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:21,920
Are you kidding me?

896
01:14:22,083 --> 01:14:24,074
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

897
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:26,800
Now take your hand off your pistol!

898
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,679
Butch, that means you too.

899
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,888
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

900
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:38,608
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

901
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:40,886
He broke my collarbone!

902
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:45,361
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

903
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:48,561
- Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

904
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:51,321
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

905
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,956
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

906
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,913
You wanna hold my hand?

907
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:05,172
Willie, take us home.

908
01:15:07,420 --> 01:15:09,411
Start moving!

909
01:15:15,803 --> 01:15:17,055
Head 'em out!

910
01:16:02,683 --> 01:16:04,284
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

911
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,645
No, sir.

912
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,313
You want a boot heel in it?

913
01:16:08,522 --> 01:16:09,478
No, sir.

914
01:16:09,648 --> 01:16:12,686
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

915
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

916
01:16:16,259 --> 01:16:17,795
Now move, nigger!

917
01:16:19,929 --> 01:16:22,057
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

918
01:16:22,223 --> 01:16:24,089
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

919
01:16:24,267 --> 01:16:27,851
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

920
01:16:28,021 --> 01:16:31,059
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he?

921
01:16:31,232 --> 01:16:32,575
Indeed.

922
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,437
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

923
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:42,336
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

924
01:16:42,493 --> 01:16:45,588
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

925
01:16:45,747 --> 01:16:50,116
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

926
01:16:53,087 --> 01:16:54,919
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

927
01:16:55,089 --> 01:16:57,137
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

928
01:17:01,179 --> 01:17:03,762
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

929
01:17:03,932 --> 01:17:07,300
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

930
01:17:07,477 --> 01:17:09,343
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

931
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,989
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

932
01:17:12,148 --> 01:17:16,779
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

933
01:17:16,945 --> 01:17:18,902
You lose sight of why we're here.

934
01:17:19,072 --> 01:17:20,873
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

935
01:17:21,032 --> 01:17:23,524
Stop antagonizing Candie.

936
01:17:23,701 --> 01:17:28,662
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

937
01:17:28,831 --> 01:17:33,496
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

938
01:17:33,670 --> 01:17:36,674
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

939
01:17:36,839 --> 01:17:39,388
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

940
01:17:40,385 --> 01:17:45,801
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

941
01:17:45,974 --> 01:17:47,772
and he didn't bat a eye.

942
01:17:49,185 --> 01:17:50,300
You remember that?

943
01:17:52,563 --> 01:17:53,906
Yeah, of course I remember.

944
01:17:54,065 --> 01:17:57,524
What you said was that
this is my world...

945
01:17:58,486 --> 01:18:00,477
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

946
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:04,368
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

947
01:18:08,037 --> 01:18:11,200
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

948
01:18:12,667 --> 01:18:14,761
...that was the general gist.

949
01:18:18,506 --> 01:18:20,008
See you at Candyland.

950
01:18:27,724 --> 01:18:30,307
All right, niggers, back at it.

951
01:18:31,602 --> 01:18:33,650
That means you too, Moonlight.

952
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:23,906
I'll be. D'Artagnan!

953
01:19:24,072 --> 01:19:27,315
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

954
01:19:27,492 --> 01:19:29,586
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

955
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,030
Yes, you can.

956
01:19:31,204 --> 01:19:34,754
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

957
01:19:34,916 --> 01:19:37,328
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

958
01:19:37,502 --> 01:19:40,119
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

959
01:19:40,296 --> 01:19:42,344
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

960
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:44,043
Hush up! Hey!

961
01:19:44,217 --> 01:19:46,834
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

962
01:19:56,354 --> 01:19:59,813
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

963
01:19:59,982 --> 01:20:01,655
Yessir.

964
01:20:24,215 --> 01:20:26,343
How long was he loose?

965
01:20:26,509 --> 01:20:29,752
A night. Day.

966
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:31,545
Half the other night.

967
01:20:32,682 --> 01:20:34,218
How far he get off the property?

968
01:20:34,392 --> 01:20:36,099
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

969
01:20:36,269 --> 01:20:38,397
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

970
01:20:38,563 --> 01:20:39,940
Hm.

971
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:44,524
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

972
01:20:44,694 --> 01:20:46,310
One-a this new lot.

973
01:20:47,488 --> 01:20:50,196
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

974
01:20:50,366 --> 01:20:52,858
Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

975
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:54,555
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

976
01:20:54,704 --> 01:20:57,116
Now, no beggin'.

977
01:20:57,290 --> 01:20:59,759
No playin' on my soft heart.

978
01:21:03,212 --> 01:21:05,761
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

979
01:21:08,676 --> 01:21:12,226
I done paid $500 for you.

980
01:21:12,388 --> 01:21:17,258
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

981
01:21:17,435 --> 01:21:19,813
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

982
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:23,859
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

983
01:21:24,025 --> 01:21:26,733
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

984
01:21:26,903 --> 01:21:28,405
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

985
01:21:28,571 --> 01:21:31,575
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

986
01:21:31,741 --> 01:21:32,788
Yessir.

987
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:37,501
Still, the fact remains:

988
01:21:37,663 --> 01:21:41,293
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

989
01:21:41,459 --> 01:21:44,008
So what about my $500, huh?

990
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,803
What about my $500?

991
01:21:49,342 --> 01:21:50,878
You gonna reimburse me?

992
01:21:56,891 --> 01:21:59,269
You even know what "reimburse" means?

993
01:21:59,435 --> 01:22:01,483
Huh?

994
01:22:07,777 --> 01:22:09,484
I'll reimburse you!

995
01:22:13,241 --> 01:22:14,447
You will?

996
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:17,196
Yep.

997
01:22:19,956 --> 01:22:22,664
You'll pay $500

998
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:26,292
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

999
01:22:26,462 --> 01:22:27,577
No, he won't.

1000
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:31,934
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1001
01:22:32,843 --> 01:22:34,800
Matter of fact, so am I.

1002
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:37,440
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1003
01:22:37,598 --> 01:22:39,478
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1004
01:22:41,143 --> 01:22:42,349
You heard him.

1005
01:22:51,529 --> 01:22:55,284
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1006
01:22:55,449 --> 01:22:59,113
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1007
01:22:59,912 --> 01:23:01,869
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1008
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:05,593
That right.

1009
01:23:06,586 --> 01:23:07,929
For that matter...

1010
01:23:09,213 --> 01:23:10,806
...nor have I.

1011
01:23:16,887 --> 01:23:18,059
Now...

1012
01:23:19,223 --> 01:23:22,352
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1013
01:23:24,854 --> 01:23:28,188
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1014
01:23:29,317 --> 01:23:30,853
He's your nigger.

1015
01:23:34,614 --> 01:23:36,708
Mr. Stonesipher?

1016
01:23:37,491 --> 01:23:41,462
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1017
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:46,411
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

1018
01:23:47,877 --> 01:23:50,096
Get 'im, get 'im!

1019
01:23:51,130 --> 01:23:53,622
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1020
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:55,210
Whoo-ee!

1021
01:24:23,579 --> 01:24:25,627
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1022
01:24:25,790 --> 01:24:27,952
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1023
01:24:28,125 --> 01:24:32,756
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1024
01:24:33,339 --> 01:24:34,625
Hm.

1025
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:37,093
You are used to it?

1026
01:24:37,259 --> 01:24:40,229
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1027
01:24:40,388 --> 01:24:45,110
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1028
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:46,883
...whenever you're ready.

1029
01:24:47,061 --> 01:24:50,429
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1030
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:52,222
Let's get to it.

1031
01:24:53,442 --> 01:24:57,811
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1032
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,443
Follow me.

1033
01:26:58,734 --> 01:27:01,442
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1034
01:27:03,072 --> 01:27:04,449
Stand up straight, now!

1035
01:27:05,616 --> 01:27:06,902
Get up there.

1036
01:27:07,076 --> 01:27:09,659
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1037
01:27:09,829 --> 01:27:11,445
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1038
01:27:11,622 --> 01:27:13,716
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1039
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,966
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1040
01:28:15,144 --> 01:28:17,818
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1041
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:20,950
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1042
01:28:21,108 --> 01:28:24,442
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1043
01:28:24,612 --> 01:28:26,990
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir.

1044
01:28:27,156 --> 01:28:30,706
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1045
01:28:30,868 --> 01:28:34,782
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1046
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:38,801
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1047
01:28:41,211 --> 01:28:45,671
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1048
01:28:45,841 --> 01:28:47,514
Hey, Snowball?

1049
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:52,303
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1050
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:55,306
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1051
01:28:55,476 --> 01:28:57,236
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1052
01:28:57,311 --> 01:28:58,688
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1053
01:28:58,854 --> 01:29:00,974
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1054
01:29:01,106 --> 01:29:05,407
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1055
01:29:05,569 --> 01:29:07,947
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1056
01:29:08,113 --> 01:29:10,366
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1057
01:29:10,532 --> 01:29:14,321
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1058
01:29:14,495 --> 01:29:17,738
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1059
01:29:17,915 --> 01:29:21,920
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1060
01:29:22,086 --> 01:29:26,000
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1061
01:29:26,173 --> 01:29:27,550
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1062
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:31,209
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1063
01:29:31,387 --> 01:29:33,765
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1064
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:35,604
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1065
01:29:35,766 --> 01:29:38,383
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1066
01:29:39,395 --> 01:29:40,897
Yessir. I understand.

1067
01:29:41,063 --> 01:29:43,532
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1068
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:45,819
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1069
01:29:46,986 --> 01:29:48,659
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1070
01:29:48,821 --> 01:29:51,040
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1071
01:29:51,198 --> 01:29:53,781
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1072
01:29:53,951 --> 01:29:56,238
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1073
01:29:56,412 --> 01:29:58,460
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1074
01:29:58,622 --> 01:30:00,966
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1075
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:03,378
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1076
01:30:03,544 --> 01:30:05,763
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1077
01:30:05,921 --> 01:30:07,844
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1078
01:30:08,007 --> 01:30:09,623
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1079
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:13,683
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1080
01:30:15,139 --> 01:30:16,311
Go on, now.

1081
01:30:17,224 --> 01:30:19,636
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1082
01:30:19,810 --> 01:30:21,153
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1083
01:30:21,311 --> 01:30:24,861
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1084
01:30:25,024 --> 01:30:26,196
Now...

1085
01:30:26,358 --> 01:30:31,023
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1086
01:30:31,196 --> 01:30:34,291
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1087
01:30:34,450 --> 01:30:39,502
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1088
01:30:39,663 --> 01:30:43,668
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1089
01:30:44,918 --> 01:30:48,286
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1090
01:30:48,464 --> 01:30:51,832
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1091
01:30:52,009 --> 01:30:54,137
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1092
01:30:54,303 --> 01:30:55,350
You know where it is.

1093
01:30:55,512 --> 01:30:57,253
Like you on a rope!

1094
01:30:58,474 --> 01:31:01,216
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1095
01:31:01,935 --> 01:31:04,939
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1096
01:31:05,105 --> 01:31:08,894
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1097
01:31:09,068 --> 01:31:10,024
Nigger gal?

1098
01:31:10,194 --> 01:31:13,198
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1099
01:31:13,363 --> 01:31:15,946
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1100
01:31:16,116 --> 01:31:20,292
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1101
01:31:20,454 --> 01:31:24,630
You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1102
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:28,160
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1103
01:31:28,337 --> 01:31:30,169
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1104
01:31:30,339 --> 01:31:31,750
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1105
01:31:31,924 --> 01:31:33,597
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1106
01:31:33,759 --> 01:31:36,433
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1107
01:31:36,637 --> 01:31:40,301
- What?
- Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1108
01:31:41,809 --> 01:31:43,089
What's she doin' there?

1109
01:31:43,143 --> 01:31:45,885
What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1110
01:31:46,063 --> 01:31:47,531
She bein' punished.

1111
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:50,033
- What she do?
- She run off again.

1112
01:31:50,192 --> 01:31:52,866
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1113
01:31:53,028 --> 01:31:55,520
- Two.
- When did she go?

1114
01:31:55,697 --> 01:31:58,189
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1115
01:31:58,367 --> 01:32:01,041
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1116
01:32:01,954 --> 01:32:05,447
Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1117
01:32:05,624 --> 01:32:09,925
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1118
01:32:10,087 --> 01:32:13,000
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1119
01:32:13,173 --> 01:32:14,379
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1120
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:16,223
How long she been in the box?

1121
01:32:16,385 --> 01:32:19,184
How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1122
01:32:19,346 --> 01:32:22,020
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1123
01:32:22,182 --> 01:32:25,220
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1124
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:29,308
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1125
01:32:29,481 --> 01:32:30,437
Hildi is my nigger.

1126
01:32:30,607 --> 01:32:33,770
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1127
01:32:33,944 --> 01:32:37,164
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1128
01:32:37,322 --> 01:32:39,734
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1129
01:32:39,908 --> 01:32:42,377
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1130
01:32:42,536 --> 01:32:46,712
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1131
01:32:46,874 --> 01:32:48,046
Yessir.

1132
01:32:49,334 --> 01:32:51,917
Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1133
01:32:52,087 --> 01:32:55,455
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1134
01:32:55,632 --> 01:32:57,009
Of course, darlin'.

1135
01:32:57,176 --> 01:33:02,046
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1136
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:05,101
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1137
01:33:09,938 --> 01:33:12,680
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1138
01:33:12,858 --> 01:33:15,407
Cora! Come here!

1139
01:33:15,569 --> 01:33:18,607
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1140
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:21,158
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1141
01:33:21,325 --> 01:33:23,794
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1142
01:33:23,952 --> 01:33:27,320
- Yessir.

1143
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,624
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1144
01:34:43,657 --> 01:34:47,207
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1145
01:36:22,381 --> 01:36:23,849
Hello, ladies.

1146
01:36:24,007 --> 01:36:27,375
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1147
01:36:31,556 --> 01:36:34,025
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1148
01:36:35,477 --> 01:36:37,605
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1149
01:36:38,647 --> 01:36:40,991
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1150
01:36:41,149 --> 01:36:43,948
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1151
01:36:47,197 --> 01:36:49,188
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1152
01:36:49,366 --> 01:36:54,327
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1153
01:36:57,666 --> 01:37:00,010
The doctor here speaks German.

1154
01:37:02,003 --> 01:37:03,960
And I've been informed you do as well?

1155
01:37:05,507 --> 01:37:07,669
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1156
01:37:14,224 --> 01:37:15,840
Ha!

1157
01:37:16,017 --> 01:37:18,008
Astonishing.

1158
01:37:24,985 --> 01:37:27,204
- And I shall bring you...
- Much obliged.

1159
01:37:36,705 --> 01:37:37,820
<i>Ja.</i>

1160
01:38:01,229 --> 01:38:02,697
Don't be afraid.

1161
01:38:40,769 --> 01:38:43,261
Hm. Pardon.

1162
01:38:50,862 --> 01:38:52,148
<i>Danke.</i>

1163
01:40:37,594 --> 01:40:39,187
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1164
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:51,071
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1165
01:40:52,651 --> 01:40:53,994
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1166
01:40:54,152 --> 01:40:55,513
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1167
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,610
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1168
01:40:58,698 --> 01:41:01,440
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1169
01:41:01,618 --> 01:41:03,837
That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1170
01:41:03,995 --> 01:41:06,578
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1171
01:41:06,748 --> 01:41:12,551
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1172
01:41:12,712 --> 01:41:17,081
But the best three by far were Samson...

1173
01:41:18,468 --> 01:41:20,069
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1174
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:23,554
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1175
01:41:23,723 --> 01:41:26,306
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1176
01:41:26,476 --> 01:41:29,571
You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1177
01:41:29,729 --> 01:41:32,312
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1178
01:41:35,985 --> 01:41:41,333
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1179
01:41:41,491 --> 01:41:45,212
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1180
01:41:45,370 --> 01:41:49,125
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1181
01:41:49,791 --> 01:41:51,885
Samson's the champion.

1182
01:41:52,043 --> 01:41:53,841
Them other two pretty good.

1183
01:41:55,130 --> 01:41:56,731
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1184
01:41:56,798 --> 01:41:57,913
It's all right.

1185
01:41:58,091 --> 01:42:00,185
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1186
01:42:00,343 --> 01:42:03,711
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1187
01:42:03,888 --> 01:42:08,189
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1188
01:42:08,351 --> 01:42:09,432
Is that right?

1189
01:42:09,602 --> 01:42:13,698
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1190
01:42:13,857 --> 01:42:14,813
Hm.

1191
01:42:14,983 --> 01:42:17,452
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1192
01:42:19,195 --> 01:42:21,414
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1193
01:42:21,573 --> 01:42:24,668
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1194
01:42:24,826 --> 01:42:27,568
- A sense of showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1195
01:42:27,746 --> 01:42:30,966
I want to be able to bill hirn
as The Black Hercules.

1196
01:42:32,917 --> 01:42:34,397
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1197
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:35,451
More like Nigger-les.

1198
01:42:37,922 --> 01:42:43,304
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1199
01:42:43,803 --> 01:42:46,602
...'the right nigger."'

1200
01:42:46,765 --> 01:42:51,066
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1201
01:42:51,227 --> 01:42:53,935
But is he right as rain?

1202
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:56,601
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1203
01:42:56,775 --> 01:43:00,564
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1204
01:43:00,737 --> 01:43:02,660
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1205
01:43:02,822 --> 01:43:04,563
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1206
01:43:04,741 --> 01:43:05,731
Nobody.

1207
01:43:05,909 --> 01:43:07,789
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1208
01:43:07,911 --> 01:43:09,311
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1209
01:43:09,454 --> 01:43:11,445
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1210
01:43:11,623 --> 01:43:12,829
Hm-mm.

1211
01:43:12,999 --> 01:43:17,209
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1212
01:43:17,378 --> 01:43:19,458
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1213
01:43:19,589 --> 01:43:23,560
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1214
01:43:23,718 --> 01:43:26,267
In other words, first thing is first.

1215
01:43:26,429 --> 01:43:27,897
First thing's first.

1216
01:43:35,563 --> 01:43:38,931
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1217
01:43:39,108 --> 01:43:40,974
Famously.

1218
01:43:41,736 --> 01:43:44,410
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1219
01:43:44,572 --> 01:43:47,906
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1220
01:43:48,076 --> 01:43:49,956
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1221
01:43:52,330 --> 01:43:54,378
Two weeks in Boston!

1222
01:43:54,541 --> 01:43:57,340
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1223
01:43:57,502 --> 01:43:59,209
Two weeks in Boston!

1224
01:43:59,379 --> 01:44:04,590
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1225
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:08,855
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1226
01:44:09,013 --> 01:44:10,879
Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1227
01:44:11,057 --> 01:44:12,400
You might-a caught yourself

1228
01:44:12,559 --> 01:44:13,811
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1229
01:44:13,977 --> 01:44:16,071
Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1230
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:18,220
- Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1231
01:44:18,398 --> 01:44:20,014
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1232
01:44:20,191 --> 01:44:23,161
Yessir, you stuck.

1233
01:44:23,319 --> 01:44:24,855
I don't know, doctor.

1234
01:44:25,029 --> 01:44:27,282
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1235
01:44:27,448 --> 01:44:31,954
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1236
01:44:34,372 --> 01:44:36,841
Well, naturally.

1237
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,630
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1238
01:44:40,795 --> 01:44:43,594
- not the plucked chicken.

1239
01:44:43,756 --> 01:44:46,248
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1240
01:44:46,426 --> 01:44:48,349
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1241
01:44:48,511 --> 01:44:49,711
You got to clean these dishes,

1242
01:44:49,721 --> 01:44:51,882
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1243
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,109
You know that nigger, don't you?

1244
01:44:55,018 --> 01:44:56,304
- Who?
- "Who?"

1245
01:44:56,477 --> 01:44:59,572
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1246
01:45:01,316 --> 01:45:03,307
At the table?

1247
01:45:03,484 --> 01:45:04,736
I don't know him.

1248
01:45:04,903 --> 01:45:07,941
- You don't know him.
- No.

1249
01:45:08,114 --> 01:45:10,947
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1250
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:18,049
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1251
01:45:22,253 --> 01:45:23,459
OK.

1252
01:45:24,714 --> 01:45:27,843
Yeah. If you say so.

1253
01:45:34,307 --> 01:45:37,732
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1254
01:45:39,103 --> 01:45:44,280
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1255
01:45:44,442 --> 01:45:46,786
What would your price be?

1256
01:45:46,945 --> 01:45:48,902
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1257
01:45:49,072 --> 01:45:52,531
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1258
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:56,736
...9,000. Maybe.

1259
01:45:57,997 --> 01:46:03,800
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1260
01:46:03,962 --> 01:46:06,124
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1261
01:46:06,297 --> 01:46:07,253
Sure wasn't.

1262
01:46:07,423 --> 01:46:09,130
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1263
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,462
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1264
01:46:11,636 --> 01:46:14,048
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1265
01:46:14,222 --> 01:46:15,942
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1266
01:46:16,015 --> 01:46:18,985
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1267
01:46:19,143 --> 01:46:23,387
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1268
01:46:24,023 --> 01:46:28,028
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1269
01:46:28,194 --> 01:46:31,027
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1270
01:46:39,205 --> 01:46:43,301
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1271
01:46:47,213 --> 01:46:49,625
Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1272
01:46:49,799 --> 01:46:53,133
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- Hooray, doctor.

1273
01:46:53,302 --> 01:46:55,430
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1274
01:46:55,596 --> 01:46:59,146
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1275
01:46:59,308 --> 01:47:02,471
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1276
01:47:02,645 --> 01:47:04,443
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1277
01:47:04,605 --> 01:47:07,700
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1278
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:10,897
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1279
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,060
Hm-mm.

1280
01:47:12,238 --> 01:47:13,911
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1281
01:47:14,073 --> 01:47:16,690
- by a physician of my choosing.
- Naturally.

1282
01:47:16,868 --> 01:47:21,590
So, say I return in about...

1283
01:47:23,750 --> 01:47:26,037
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1284
01:47:26,210 --> 01:47:27,462
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1285
01:47:27,628 --> 01:47:29,676
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1286
01:47:29,839 --> 01:47:32,809
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1287
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:36,672
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1288
01:47:37,430 --> 01:47:38,602
Gentlemen...

1289
01:47:39,599 --> 01:47:41,590
...may I propose a toast.

1290
01:47:43,978 --> 01:47:48,848
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1291
01:47:49,025 --> 01:47:51,699
- To The Black Hercules.

1292
01:47:51,861 --> 01:47:53,238
The Black Hercules.

1293
01:47:53,404 --> 01:47:54,815
To The Black Hercules.

1294
01:47:54,989 --> 01:47:58,835
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.

1295
01:47:58,993 --> 01:48:00,404
Hm.

1296
01:48:00,578 --> 01:48:03,821
Hildi, top my drink off.

1297
01:48:06,918 --> 01:48:11,970
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1298
01:48:12,131 --> 01:48:15,351
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1299
01:48:15,510 --> 01:48:18,252
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1300
01:48:18,429 --> 01:48:21,171
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1301
01:48:21,349 --> 01:48:22,692
through a bramble bush.

1302
01:48:22,850 --> 01:48:25,971
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1303
01:48:26,104 --> 01:48:27,697
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1304
01:48:27,855 --> 01:48:29,027
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1305
01:48:29,190 --> 01:48:30,658
No, sir.

1306
01:48:30,817 --> 01:48:32,160
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1307
01:48:32,318 --> 01:48:35,982
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1308
01:48:36,155 --> 01:48:39,398
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1309
01:48:39,575 --> 01:48:41,703
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1310
01:48:41,869 --> 01:48:44,907
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1311
01:48:45,081 --> 01:48:46,822
No, we just talked and...

1312
01:48:46,999 --> 01:48:49,377
Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1313
01:48:49,544 --> 01:48:51,342
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1314
01:48:51,504 --> 01:48:53,552
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1315
01:48:53,714 --> 01:48:56,809
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1316
01:48:56,968 --> 01:48:58,925
- Go on.
- Uh, Calvin.

1317
01:48:59,095 --> 01:49:01,473
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1318
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:04,552
But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1319
01:49:04,725 --> 01:49:07,729
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1320
01:49:07,895 --> 01:49:10,478
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1321
01:49:10,648 --> 01:49:14,232
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1322
01:49:14,402 --> 01:49:16,564
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1323
01:49:16,737 --> 01:49:18,737
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1324
01:49:18,865 --> 01:49:19,946
- Sure would.
- Look at that, doctor.

1325
01:49:20,116 --> 01:49:22,369
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1326
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:26,199
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1327
01:49:27,874 --> 01:49:30,286
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1328
01:49:30,459 --> 01:49:33,133
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1329
01:49:34,338 --> 01:49:36,136
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1330
01:49:42,513 --> 01:49:44,049
Cora, come get this girl!

1331
01:49:47,518 --> 01:49:50,738
- She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. Oh!

1332
01:49:50,897 --> 01:49:53,366
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1333
01:49:53,524 --> 01:49:54,867
Come on in here.

1334
01:50:01,365 --> 01:50:05,154
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1335
01:50:05,328 --> 01:50:07,285
You say you ain't know him.

1336
01:50:08,414 --> 01:50:09,495
Huh?

1337
01:50:09,665 --> 01:50:15,263
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1338
01:50:16,422 --> 01:50:19,790
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1339
01:50:21,969 --> 01:50:23,585
Mr. Stephen...

1340
01:50:24,597 --> 01:50:25,587
...I don't.

1341
01:50:25,765 --> 01:50:28,257
Why is you lying to me?

1342
01:50:30,645 --> 01:50:31,988
I ain't.

1343
01:50:32,146 --> 01:50:34,638
Then why is you crying?

1344
01:50:34,815 --> 01:50:36,977
You scarin' me.

1345
01:50:37,151 --> 01:50:41,065
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1346
01:50:42,740 --> 01:50:45,835
To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1347
01:50:45,993 --> 01:50:49,122
was positively soul-enriching.

1348
01:50:49,288 --> 01:50:52,167
Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1349
01:50:52,333 --> 01:50:55,166
You stay right here.

1350
01:51:00,508 --> 01:51:05,014
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1351
01:51:05,179 --> 01:51:08,012
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1352
01:51:10,017 --> 01:51:15,979
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1353
01:51:16,148 --> 01:51:17,525
I'm all ears.

1354
01:51:17,692 --> 01:51:19,399
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1355
01:51:20,027 --> 01:51:21,620
- Monsieur Candie...
- Stephen!

1356
01:51:22,655 --> 01:51:25,124
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1357
01:51:26,242 --> 01:51:28,370
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:51:28,536 --> 01:51:31,244
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1359
01:51:31,414 --> 01:51:32,529
Excuse him.

1360
01:51:32,707 --> 01:51:36,462
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1361
01:51:36,627 --> 01:51:38,550
You mean get up out of my chair?

1362
01:51:38,713 --> 01:51:42,047
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1363
01:51:42,216 --> 01:51:46,062
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1364
01:51:46,220 --> 01:51:48,837
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1365
01:51:49,015 --> 01:51:50,881
We're having white cake!

1366
01:51:51,058 --> 01:51:53,402
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1367
01:51:53,561 --> 01:51:57,896
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1368
01:51:58,065 --> 01:51:59,863
Meet me in the library.

1369
01:52:00,026 --> 01:52:03,121
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1370
01:52:03,279 --> 01:52:05,145
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1371
01:52:05,323 --> 01:52:10,318
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1372
01:52:10,494 --> 01:52:11,666
Yessir.

1373
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:16,244
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1374
01:52:16,417 --> 01:52:18,258
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1375
01:52:18,336 --> 01:52:21,966
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1376
01:52:24,967 --> 01:52:26,765
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1377
01:52:32,933 --> 01:52:34,731
You may clear
the dinner service.

1378
01:52:36,187 --> 01:52:39,555
You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1379
01:52:39,732 --> 01:52:45,148
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1380
01:52:45,321 --> 01:52:47,995
The circus?

1381
01:52:54,455 --> 01:52:56,253
What is the matter?

1382
01:53:01,504 --> 01:53:06,590
Them motherfuckers
ain't hereto buy no Mandingos.

1383
01:53:06,759 --> 01:53:10,309
- They wants that girl.

1384
01:53:10,471 --> 01:53:13,213
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1385
01:53:13,391 --> 01:53:16,554
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1386
01:53:16,727 --> 01:53:20,391
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1387
01:53:20,564 --> 01:53:22,726
They here for that girl.

1388
01:53:22,900 --> 01:53:25,517
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1389
01:53:25,694 --> 01:53:29,324
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1390
01:53:31,033 --> 01:53:32,626
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1391
01:53:32,785 --> 01:53:35,163
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1392
01:53:35,329 --> 01:53:37,798
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1393
01:53:37,957 --> 01:53:40,210
But he's just about to buy

1394
01:53:40,376 --> 01:53:43,596
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1395
01:53:43,754 --> 01:53:46,758
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1396
01:53:52,179 --> 01:53:54,170
Where you gettin' all this?

1397
01:53:55,307 --> 01:53:57,105
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1398
01:53:57,268 --> 01:53:59,760
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1399
01:53:59,937 --> 01:54:04,238
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1400
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:06,232
She probably his wife.

1401
01:54:06,402 --> 01:54:09,201
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1402
01:54:09,363 --> 01:54:12,458
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1403
01:54:15,035 --> 01:54:16,992
If she's who they want...

1404
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:21,881
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1405
01:54:22,042 --> 01:54:25,535
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1406
01:54:25,713 --> 01:54:31,186
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1407
01:54:33,888 --> 01:54:35,561
Yes, it did.

1408
01:54:38,893 --> 01:54:40,509
His Wife, huh?

1409
01:54:44,398 --> 01:54:48,119
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1410
01:54:51,405 --> 01:54:53,396
Those lying...

1411
01:54:54,241 --> 01:55:00,237
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1412
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,630
Sons of bitches!

1413
01:55:04,251 --> 01:55:09,041
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1414
01:55:10,299 --> 01:55:11,767
Oh, there you are.

1415
01:55:11,926 --> 01:55:14,725
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1416
01:55:16,514 --> 01:55:18,676
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1417
01:55:18,849 --> 01:55:21,944
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1418
01:55:22,102 --> 01:55:25,140
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1419
01:55:25,314 --> 01:55:26,395
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1420
01:55:26,565 --> 01:55:30,445
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1421
01:55:30,611 --> 01:55:32,864
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1422
01:55:46,126 --> 01:55:49,847
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1423
01:55:51,882 --> 01:55:54,795
Apropos, before your exit,

1424
01:55:54,969 --> 01:55:58,974
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1425
01:55:59,139 --> 01:56:02,052
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1426
01:56:02,226 --> 01:56:04,354
And we will again. In a moment.

1427
01:56:20,828 --> 01:56:22,876
Who's your little friend?

1428
01:56:27,835 --> 01:56:29,337
This is Ben.

1429
01:56:30,671 --> 01:56:35,666
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1430
01:56:35,843 --> 01:56:38,255
And I do mean a long damn time.

1431
01:56:39,346 --> 01:56:43,101
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1432
01:56:43,976 --> 01:56:46,024
...and my daddy's daddy.

1433
01:56:46,186 --> 01:56:48,769
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1434
01:56:51,609 --> 01:56:53,282
...Old Ben took care of me.

1435
01:56:55,863 --> 01:56:59,652
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1436
01:56:59,825 --> 01:57:05,696
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1437
01:57:07,333 --> 01:57:12,624
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1438
01:57:13,881 --> 01:57:17,670
...surrounded by black faces.

1439
01:57:19,720 --> 01:57:22,064
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1440
01:57:22,222 --> 01:57:25,385
I only had one question:

1441
01:57:29,104 --> 01:57:31,573
- Why don't they kill us?

1442
01:57:34,568 --> 01:57:39,745
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1443
01:57:39,907 --> 01:57:44,834
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1444
01:57:44,995 --> 01:57:50,115
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1445
01:57:50,292 --> 01:57:53,717
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1446
01:57:56,256 --> 01:57:57,758
But he never did.

1447
01:57:59,635 --> 01:58:00,921
Why not?

1448
01:58:02,304 --> 01:58:07,094
You see, the science of phrenology

1449
01:58:07,267 --> 01:58:12,353
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1450
01:58:14,191 --> 01:58:17,912
In the skull of the African here,

1451
01:58:18,070 --> 01:58:20,198
the area associated
with submissiveness

1452
01:58:20,364 --> 01:58:25,871
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1453
01:58:41,385 --> 01:58:43,342
If you examine...

1454
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,884
...this piece of skull here...

1455
01:58:53,188 --> 01:58:56,772
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1456
01:59:00,362 --> 01:59:04,083
Here, here and here.

1457
01:59:04,241 --> 01:59:05,493
Now...

1458
01:59:05,659 --> 01:59:10,654
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1459
01:59:10,831 --> 01:59:13,323
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1460
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:16,834
most associated with... creativity.

1461
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:19,336
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1462
01:59:19,965 --> 01:59:22,093
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1463
01:59:22,259 --> 01:59:24,546
unburdened by genius,

1464
01:59:24,720 --> 01:59:28,896
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1465
01:59:30,017 --> 01:59:31,360
...servility.

1466
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:34,093
Now, Bright Boy...

1467
01:59:35,022 --> 01:59:37,184
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1468
01:59:39,651 --> 01:59:41,745
But if I took this hammer here...

1469
01:59:43,864 --> 01:59:46,208
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1470
01:59:47,201 --> 01:59:52,549
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1471
01:59:53,791 --> 01:59:55,259
...as Old Ben.

1472
01:59:56,376 --> 01:59:59,960
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1473
02:00:00,130 --> 02:00:03,100
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1474
02:00:03,258 --> 02:00:06,501
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1475
02:00:07,596 --> 02:00:10,725
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1476
02:00:10,891 --> 02:00:13,235
but that you can believe!

1477
02:00:13,393 --> 02:00:16,192
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1478
02:00:16,355 --> 02:00:18,733
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1479
02:00:23,445 --> 02:00:25,857
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1480
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:31,787
Where were we?

1481
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:37,661
Jackass.

1482
02:00:41,672 --> 02:00:43,174
Ah, yes.

1483
02:00:43,340 --> 02:00:46,082
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1484
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,729
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1485
02:00:48,887 --> 02:00:50,264
Am I right?

1486
02:00:54,268 --> 02:00:55,611
Right.

1487
02:00:58,021 --> 02:00:59,523
Bring Out Hildi!

1488
02:01:02,276 --> 02:01:03,812
Get over there yonder.

1489
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:07,532
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1490
02:01:07,698 --> 02:01:09,098
Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1491
02:01:09,116 --> 02:01:10,652
Now shut your mouth!

1492
02:01:14,955 --> 02:01:17,538
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1493
02:01:17,708 --> 02:01:20,450
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1494
02:01:20,627 --> 02:01:24,962
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1495
02:01:25,132 --> 02:01:28,170
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1496
02:01:28,343 --> 02:01:32,314
To which you said, "$12,000."

1497
02:01:33,098 --> 02:01:34,839
- Now, considering y'all

1498
02:01:35,017 --> 02:01:36,974
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1499
02:01:37,144 --> 02:01:41,115
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1500
02:01:41,273 --> 02:01:43,685
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1501
02:01:43,859 --> 02:01:49,821
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1502
02:01:49,990 --> 02:01:53,745
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1503
02:01:53,911 --> 02:01:59,543
the price is $12,000.

1504
02:01:59,708 --> 02:02:03,497
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1505
02:02:05,756 --> 02:02:07,292
Yes, I do, doctor.

1506
02:02:08,133 --> 02:02:11,137
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1507
02:02:11,303 --> 02:02:14,853
Broomhilda here is my property.

1508
02:02:15,015 --> 02:02:20,135
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1509
02:02:21,229 --> 02:02:23,516
And if y'all think my price...

1510
02:02:24,191 --> 02:02:26,899
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1511
02:02:27,069 --> 02:02:30,528
- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1512
02:02:34,451 --> 02:02:37,580
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1513
02:02:37,746 --> 02:02:39,874
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1514
02:02:40,040 --> 02:02:44,546
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1515
02:02:44,711 --> 02:02:48,887
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1516
02:02:49,049 --> 02:02:50,392
- What's it gonna be?

1517
02:02:50,550 --> 02:02:54,430
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1518
02:02:55,639 --> 02:02:56,982
Yes, you may.

1519
02:03:10,737 --> 02:03:11,943
That 12.

1520
02:03:15,993 --> 02:03:17,859
- Sold!

1521
02:03:18,036 --> 02:03:20,585
To the man with the exceptional beard

1522
02:03:20,747 --> 02:03:24,081
and his unexceptional nigger.

1523
02:03:29,923 --> 02:03:32,210
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1524
02:03:32,384 --> 02:03:36,048
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1525
02:03:36,221 --> 02:03:37,962
$12,000.

1526
02:03:41,101 --> 02:03:43,263
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1527
02:03:44,146 --> 02:03:45,887
Now, gentlemen...

1528
02:03:47,107 --> 02:03:48,973
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1529
02:03:49,943 --> 02:03:52,412
...we will be serving white cake.

1530
02:05:20,742 --> 02:05:22,085
Well done, Calvin.

1531
02:05:24,579 --> 02:05:27,458
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1532
02:05:28,917 --> 02:05:32,581
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1533
02:05:36,842 --> 02:05:37,923
Doctor!

1534
02:05:38,093 --> 02:05:40,710
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1535
02:05:40,887 --> 02:05:42,059
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1536
02:05:42,222 --> 02:05:43,565
Let it be.

1537
02:05:43,723 --> 02:05:45,646
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1538
02:05:45,809 --> 02:05:47,220
I'll handle this.

1539
02:06:13,086 --> 02:06:14,372
White cake?

1540
02:06:15,380 --> 02:06:17,633
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1541
02:06:18,675 --> 02:06:19,881
Hm.

1542
02:06:27,601 --> 02:06:30,309
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1543
02:06:31,021 --> 02:06:35,777
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1544
02:06:35,942 --> 02:06:37,774
D'Artagnan.

1545
02:06:38,570 --> 02:06:42,359
And I was wondering What
Dumas would make of all this.

1546
02:06:42,532 --> 02:06:44,000
Come again?

1547
02:06:47,078 --> 02:06:51,117
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote <i>The Three Musketeers.</i>

1548
02:06:51,291 --> 02:06:52,964
Yes, of course, doctor.

1549
02:06:53,126 --> 02:06:54,662
I figured you must be an admirer.

1550
02:06:54,836 --> 02:06:59,262
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1551
02:06:59,424 --> 02:07:03,145
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1552
02:07:03,303 --> 02:07:05,260
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1553
02:07:07,307 --> 02:07:09,139
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1554
02:07:11,353 --> 02:07:16,530
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1555
02:07:18,818 --> 02:07:20,616
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1556
02:07:22,489 --> 02:07:24,708
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1557
02:07:28,536 --> 02:07:31,335
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1558
02:07:31,498 --> 02:07:33,171
- May I?
- Of course.

1559
02:07:33,333 --> 02:07:34,710
Thank you.

1560
02:07:36,836 --> 02:07:39,806
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1561
02:07:39,965 --> 02:07:42,127
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1562
02:07:42,300 --> 02:07:44,519
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1563
02:07:45,762 --> 02:07:48,675
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1564
02:08:09,995 --> 02:08:11,201
Thank you.

1565
02:08:14,791 --> 02:08:17,078
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1566
02:08:19,337 --> 02:08:21,715
...consider yourself a free woman.

1567
02:08:33,643 --> 02:08:35,600
Mr. Candie...

1568
02:08:37,564 --> 02:08:41,353
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1569
02:08:41,526 --> 02:08:45,986
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1570
02:08:46,156 --> 02:08:48,500
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1571
02:08:48,658 --> 02:08:53,323
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1572
02:08:57,208 --> 02:08:58,494
Let's go.

1573
02:08:59,461 --> 02:09:00,997
Come on.

1574
02:09:02,714 --> 02:09:04,808
One more moment, doctor!

1575
02:09:06,676 --> 02:09:07,723
What?

1576
02:09:12,432 --> 02:09:14,560
It's a custom here in the South...

1577
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:20,442
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1578
02:09:21,274 --> 02:09:23,322
It implies good faith.

1579
02:09:23,485 --> 02:09:26,523
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1580
02:09:26,696 --> 02:09:28,983
...in my house, doctor.

1581
02:09:29,866 --> 02:09:32,779
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1582
02:09:32,952 --> 02:09:34,943
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1583
02:09:35,121 --> 02:09:38,421
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1584
02:09:39,042 --> 02:09:42,046
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1585
02:09:42,212 --> 02:09:44,010
No, I don't.

1586
02:09:45,673 --> 02:09:50,884
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1587
02:09:51,054 --> 02:09:56,015
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1588
02:09:56,184 --> 02:09:58,801
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1589
02:09:59,687 --> 02:10:02,520
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1590
02:10:03,483 --> 02:10:06,976
...you don't shake my hand.

1591
02:10:07,946 --> 02:10:13,624
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1592
02:10:13,785 --> 02:10:15,526
I don't think so.

1593
02:10:16,538 --> 02:10:17,710
Mr. Pooch?

1594
02:10:19,541 --> 02:10:24,263
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1595
02:10:24,421 --> 02:10:26,162
you cut her ass down.

1596
02:10:48,194 --> 02:10:51,528
You really want me to shake your hand?

1597
02:10:53,199 --> 02:10:54,792
I insist.

1598
02:10:55,869 --> 02:10:58,543
If you insist.

1599
02:11:15,138 --> 02:11:18,142
No! Calvin!

1600
02:11:19,225 --> 02:11:20,818
Calvin!

1601
02:11:27,150 --> 02:11:29,642
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1602
02:11:41,915 --> 02:11:44,077
Nigger's gone crazy! Help!

1603
02:11:44,250 --> 02:11:46,048
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1604
02:11:52,008 --> 02:11:53,055
Ah!

1605
02:12:03,102 --> 02:12:04,217
Holy...!

1606
02:12:04,395 --> 02:12:06,614
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1607
02:12:10,777 --> 02:12:11,983
Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1608
02:12:12,153 --> 02:12:14,497
- Get the...!

1609
02:12:16,491 --> 02:12:17,959
Damn it, son of a bitch!

1610
02:12:18,117 --> 02:12:19,653
What...? Fucking...

1611
02:12:19,827 --> 02:12:21,443
Goddamn it!

1612
02:12:22,789 --> 02:12:25,076
- What the fuck is going on?

1613
02:12:25,250 --> 02:12:27,207
You shot me!

1614
02:12:27,377 --> 02:12:30,472
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- Sorry, Jessie!

1615
02:12:30,630 --> 02:12:34,749
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1616
02:13:04,789 --> 02:13:05,904
Aim low!

1617
02:13:08,251 --> 02:13:10,083
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1618
02:13:11,045 --> 02:13:13,207
God! Oh, my God!

1619
02:13:13,381 --> 02:13:15,338
Motherfucker!

1620
02:13:24,183 --> 02:13:25,355
Shit!

1621
02:14:22,325 --> 02:14:23,406
Shit.

1622
02:14:35,588 --> 02:14:36,999
Hold your fire!

1623
02:14:40,426 --> 02:14:41,928
Hold your fire!

1624
02:14:43,846 --> 02:14:45,712
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1625
02:14:54,524 --> 02:14:55,867
Django!

1626
02:14:56,025 --> 02:14:57,277
What?

1627
02:15:00,488 --> 02:15:02,104
We got your woman!

1628
02:15:03,533 --> 02:15:06,025
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1629
02:15:06,202 --> 02:15:08,785
- You don't stop all that carrying on,

1630
02:15:08,955 --> 02:15:11,993
- he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

1631
02:15:12,166 --> 02:15:16,137
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1632
02:15:17,755 --> 02:15:18,961
Or...

1633
02:15:19,132 --> 02:15:22,136
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1634
02:15:23,261 --> 02:15:25,423
- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1635
02:15:25,596 --> 02:15:29,317
Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1636
02:15:30,393 --> 02:15:35,024
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1637
02:15:36,482 --> 02:15:38,894
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1638
02:15:39,068 --> 02:15:41,776
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1639
02:15:41,946 --> 02:15:44,984
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1640
02:15:45,158 --> 02:15:49,038
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1641
02:15:51,289 --> 02:15:55,044
Don't do it.
You give me up.

1642
02:15:55,209 --> 02:15:57,041
- Six!
- Just let me go.

1643
02:15:57,211 --> 02:15:58,747
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1644
02:15:58,921 --> 02:16:00,514
- Django.
- Eight!

1645
02:16:00,673 --> 02:16:03,165
- I love you.
- Nine!

1646
02:16:03,342 --> 02:16:05,436
- Hold it!
- No.

1647
02:16:07,430 --> 02:16:08,511
I give up.

1648
02:16:09,724 --> 02:16:12,466
I can't hear you, nigger.

1649
02:16:12,643 --> 02:16:15,135
I said I give up!

1650
02:16:38,252 --> 02:16:40,801
No!

1651
02:16:41,964 --> 02:16:43,432
No!

1652
02:18:14,682 --> 02:18:17,265
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1653
02:18:22,565 --> 02:18:24,693
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1654
02:18:25,651 --> 02:18:28,393
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1655
02:18:29,405 --> 02:18:31,624
We found your wanted posters...

1656
02:18:32,199 --> 02:18:34,418
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1657
02:18:35,828 --> 02:18:37,444
I got to say...

1658
02:18:38,164 --> 02:18:41,464
...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1659
02:18:41,626 --> 02:18:44,664
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1660
02:18:45,713 --> 02:18:48,330
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1661
02:18:57,808 --> 02:18:59,640
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

1662
02:18:59,810 --> 02:19:02,484
- On three. One...

1663
02:19:02,647 --> 02:19:05,526
- I got you. Two...

1664
02:19:05,691 --> 02:19:08,911
- Calm down, now, here it comes.

1665
02:19:09,070 --> 02:19:11,653
Captain?

1666
02:19:11,822 --> 02:19:13,563
Miss Lara want to see you.

1667
02:19:14,408 --> 02:19:18,322
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1668
02:19:18,496 --> 02:19:22,285
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1669
02:19:23,084 --> 02:19:25,917
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1670
02:19:27,755 --> 02:19:29,883
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1671
02:19:37,139 --> 02:19:38,937
How disappointing.

1672
02:20:01,872 --> 02:20:03,215
You leavin'.

1673
02:20:04,875 --> 02:20:07,913
This here what you take with you.

1674
02:20:11,298 --> 02:20:14,757
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

1675
02:20:14,927 --> 02:20:18,352
could talk about
for the last few hours.

1676
02:20:18,514 --> 02:20:22,235
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1677
02:20:22,393 --> 02:20:25,101
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1678
02:20:25,271 --> 02:20:30,562
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1679
02:20:30,735 --> 02:20:36,276
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1680
02:20:37,867 --> 02:20:40,120
...when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1681
02:20:40,286 --> 02:20:44,496
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1682
02:20:44,665 --> 02:20:46,258
Most of 'em.

1683
02:20:46,459 --> 02:20:49,622
Well, more than most.

1684
02:20:50,379 --> 02:20:56,216
Then I says: "Shitfire."

1685
02:20:56,385 --> 02:21:00,390
"The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1686
02:21:01,432 --> 02:21:04,140
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1687
02:21:04,310 --> 02:21:07,610
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1688
02:21:07,772 --> 02:21:10,992
And I said,
"What's so special about that?"

1689
02:21:11,150 --> 02:21:13,278
"We do that shit all the time."

1690
02:21:13,444 --> 02:21:19,315
"Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1691
02:21:20,451 --> 02:21:23,159
Lo and behold,

1692
02:21:23,329 --> 02:21:28,176
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1693
02:21:28,334 --> 02:21:31,793
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1694
02:21:34,173 --> 02:21:39,293
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1695
02:21:39,470 --> 02:21:43,020
henceforth, till the day you die,

1696
02:21:43,182 --> 02:21:46,311
all day, every day,

1697
02:21:46,477 --> 02:21:49,310
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1698
02:21:49,480 --> 02:21:54,111
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1699
02:21:54,276 --> 02:21:58,873
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1700
02:21:59,031 --> 02:22:01,944
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1701
02:22:02,118 --> 02:22:04,530
and say, "Get to work!"

1702
02:22:04,703 --> 02:22:07,115
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1703
02:22:07,289 --> 02:22:09,633
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1704
02:22:09,792 --> 02:22:13,456
Oh, they does that real good.

1705
02:22:13,629 --> 02:22:15,222
They gonna work ya.

1706
02:22:15,381 --> 02:22:20,376
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1707
02:22:20,553 --> 02:22:23,136
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1708
02:22:23,305 --> 02:22:25,717
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1709
02:22:25,891 --> 02:22:31,273
And that will be the story of you,
Django.

1710
02:23:10,311 --> 02:23:12,871
And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1711
02:23:12,938 --> 02:23:15,066
You don't root abos.

1712
02:23:19,820 --> 02:23:21,288
Hey, white boy.

1713
02:23:22,823 --> 02:23:24,985
I said, hey, white boy.

1714
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:28,254
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1715
02:23:28,412 --> 02:23:30,699
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1716
02:23:30,873 --> 02:23:32,045
Do what, now?

1717
02:23:32,208 --> 02:23:38,011
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1718
02:23:38,172 --> 02:23:40,129
What the fuck are you talking about?

1719
02:23:40,299 --> 02:23:44,964
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1720
02:23:45,137 --> 02:23:47,970
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1721
02:23:48,933 --> 02:23:50,640
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1722
02:23:50,809 --> 02:23:55,019
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1723
02:23:55,189 --> 02:23:56,600
You can't steal it.

1724
02:23:56,774 --> 02:23:58,447
You got to earn it, white boy.

1725
02:23:59,401 --> 02:24:01,392
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1726
02:24:01,570 --> 02:24:04,790
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1727
02:24:04,949 --> 02:24:07,077
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1728
02:24:07,243 --> 02:24:09,587
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1729
02:24:09,745 --> 02:24:11,213
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1730
02:24:11,372 --> 02:24:14,672
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1731
02:24:14,833 --> 02:24:16,426
the Bacall Gang.

1732
02:24:16,585 --> 02:24:19,828
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1733
02:24:20,005 --> 02:24:23,339
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1734
02:24:23,509 --> 02:24:26,752
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1735
02:24:26,929 --> 02:24:29,637
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1736
02:24:29,807 --> 02:24:31,218
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1737
02:24:31,392 --> 02:24:33,520
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1738
02:24:33,686 --> 02:24:37,350
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1739
02:24:37,523 --> 02:24:39,059
But it ain't got to be that way.

1740
02:24:39,233 --> 02:24:42,533
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1741
02:24:42,695 --> 02:24:43,855
What'd these jokers do again?

1742
02:24:43,946 --> 02:24:47,439
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1743
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,859
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1744
02:24:51,954 --> 02:24:54,958
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1745
02:24:55,124 --> 02:24:56,296
Get it out.

1746
02:24:58,043 --> 02:25:03,300
"Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1747
02:25:03,465 --> 02:25:04,808
- But you're a slave.
- "For murder..."

1748
02:25:04,967 --> 02:25:07,459
- I ain't no goddamn slave.
- "...and stagecoach robbery."

1749
02:25:07,636 --> 02:25:08,916
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1750
02:25:09,221 --> 02:25:10,782
- "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1751
02:25:10,848 --> 02:25:13,647
- That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1752
02:25:15,060 --> 02:25:17,643
Yesterday, as a free man,

1753
02:25:17,813 --> 02:25:22,353
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1754
02:25:22,526 --> 02:25:24,062
Dr. King Schultz.

1755
02:25:24,236 --> 02:25:28,992
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1756
02:25:29,158 --> 02:25:32,071
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1757
02:25:32,244 --> 02:25:35,737
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1758
02:25:35,914 --> 02:25:39,248
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1759
02:25:39,418 --> 02:25:43,594
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1760
02:25:45,591 --> 02:25:47,514
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1761
02:25:47,676 --> 02:25:50,475
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1762
02:25:50,637 --> 02:25:53,971
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1763
02:25:54,141 --> 02:25:57,441
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1764
02:25:57,603 --> 02:25:59,856
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1765
02:26:00,022 --> 02:26:01,763
What's the deal?

1766
02:26:01,940 --> 02:26:05,399
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1767
02:26:05,569 --> 02:26:08,448
No, no, no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1768
02:26:08,614 --> 02:26:12,107
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1769
02:26:12,284 --> 02:26:16,790
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1770
02:26:16,955 --> 02:26:18,821
This is a real handbill.

1771
02:26:18,999 --> 02:26:20,046
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1772
02:26:20,209 --> 02:26:22,303
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1773
02:26:22,461 --> 02:26:28,389
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1774
02:26:33,055 --> 02:26:35,854
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1775
02:26:42,189 --> 02:26:46,160
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1776
02:26:47,361 --> 02:26:49,978
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1777
02:26:50,697 --> 02:26:52,529
Is he a Candyland slave,

1778
02:26:52,699 --> 02:26:56,488
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1779
02:26:56,662 --> 02:27:00,326
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1780
02:27:00,499 --> 02:27:03,048
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1781
02:27:03,710 --> 02:27:07,886
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1782
02:27:08,048 --> 02:27:09,550
He weren't no slave.

1783
02:27:09,716 --> 02:27:13,562
- You fuckin' sure about that?
- Damn sure.

1784
02:27:17,516 --> 02:27:21,066
- What happened over in Candyland?
- Bunch-a shootin'.

1785
02:27:21,228 --> 02:27:23,026
Massa got shot.

1786
02:27:23,188 --> 02:27:25,316
- Who shot him?
- The German.

1787
02:27:25,482 --> 02:27:26,529
Why'd he do that?

1788
02:27:27,192 --> 02:27:30,651
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1789
02:27:30,821 --> 02:27:33,916
- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.

1790
02:27:34,992 --> 02:27:38,326
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1791
02:27:39,371 --> 02:27:42,591
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1792
02:27:44,084 --> 02:27:46,917
- I got one more condition.
- What's that?

1793
02:27:47,087 --> 02:27:50,876
When we get there, when time come...

1794
02:27:52,259 --> 02:27:55,229
- ...you let me help you kill 'em.
- Hey...

1795
02:27:55,387 --> 02:27:57,060
...you're a funny bugger.

1796
02:27:57,222 --> 02:27:59,600
- Cut him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1797
02:27:59,766 --> 02:28:01,564
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1798
02:28:01,727 --> 02:28:03,889
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1799
02:28:04,062 --> 02:28:05,769
Hey!

1800
02:28:05,939 --> 02:28:07,339
You're all right for a black fella.

1801
02:28:07,441 --> 02:28:08,693
Oh, yeah.

1802
02:28:13,906 --> 02:28:15,579
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1803
02:28:15,741 --> 02:28:17,118
Yeah.

1804
02:28:17,284 --> 02:28:19,958
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1805
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:22,077
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1806
02:28:22,247 --> 02:28:24,113
- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1807
02:28:24,291 --> 02:28:26,214
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1808
02:28:26,376 --> 02:28:28,242
I can understand that.

1809
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:31,253
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1810
02:28:31,423 --> 02:28:33,255
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1811
02:28:34,885 --> 02:28:37,047
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

1812
02:28:48,607 --> 02:28:51,281
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

1813
02:28:51,443 --> 02:28:52,433
Yeah, right.

1814
02:28:52,611 --> 02:28:55,160
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1815
02:28:55,322 --> 02:28:56,608
Righto.

1816
02:28:56,782 --> 02:28:59,911
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing,
all right?

1817
02:29:00,077 --> 02:29:02,990
I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1818
02:29:03,163 --> 02:29:04,278
Oh, that's good to know.

1819
02:30:36,673 --> 02:30:38,380
Throw me up that dynamite.

1820
02:32:08,807 --> 02:32:10,423
- Jake!
- Yeah?

1821
02:32:10,600 --> 02:32:13,968
Get out there and see what's
wrong with them goddamn dogs!

1822
02:32:18,775 --> 02:32:20,732
D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

1823
02:32:26,032 --> 02:32:27,534
- Hey!

1824
02:33:50,408 --> 02:33:51,785
Auf Wiedersehen.

1825
02:34:52,220 --> 02:34:53,813
It's me, baby.

1826
02:36:13,385 --> 02:36:15,638
Would you prepare us some coffee?

1827
02:36:15,804 --> 02:36:17,932
Sheba, you help her.

1828
02:36:18,098 --> 02:36:19,441
Come on.

1829
02:36:29,651 --> 02:36:33,406
Oh, y'all gonna be together with Calvin
in the by-and-by, all right.

1830
02:36:39,619 --> 02:36:41,747
Just a bit sooner
than y'all was expectin'.

1831
02:36:50,463 --> 02:36:51,999
Billy Crash.

1832
02:36:52,173 --> 02:36:53,846
- Now, where were we?

1833
02:36:54,009 --> 02:36:56,478
Oh, that's right.

1834
02:36:56,636 --> 02:37:01,005
Last time I seen you,
you had your hands on my...

1835
02:37:13,611 --> 02:37:17,070
D-jango!
You black son of a bitch!

1836
02:37:17,240 --> 02:37:18,617
The D is silent, hillbilly.

1837
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:21,066
Oh, no!

1838
02:37:23,079 --> 02:37:25,787
Now, all you black folks,

1839
02:37:25,957 --> 02:37:29,325
I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

1840
02:37:30,295 --> 02:37:31,968
Not you, Stephen.

1841
02:37:32,505 --> 02:37:34,667
You right where you belong.

1842
02:37:37,052 --> 02:37:41,478
Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

1843
02:37:41,639 --> 02:37:46,486
- Do what now?
- I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."

1844
02:37:48,104 --> 02:37:50,323
- Bye, Miss Lara.

1845
02:37:54,069 --> 02:37:55,241
Y'all two run along now.

1846
02:38:13,797 --> 02:38:18,257
Stephen, how you like my new duds?

1847
02:38:19,260 --> 02:38:21,843
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

1848
02:38:33,483 --> 02:38:35,406
I count six shots, nigger.

1849
02:38:36,861 --> 02:38:38,693
I count two guns, nigger.

1850
02:38:42,700 --> 02:38:44,532
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

1851
02:38:44,702 --> 02:38:47,319
you seen all manner-a shit
done to niggers.

1852
02:38:47,497 --> 02:38:50,535
But I notice,
you didn't mention kneecappin'.

1853
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:54,163
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

1854
02:38:54,337 --> 02:38:56,297
- Seventy-six years, Stephen.

1855
02:38:56,381 --> 02:38:58,054
How many niggers you think
you see come and go, huh?

1856
02:38:58,216 --> 02:38:59,809
Seven thousand?

1857
02:38:59,968 --> 02:39:01,675
Eight thousand?

1858
02:39:01,845 --> 02:39:03,552
Nine thousand?

1859
02:39:03,721 --> 02:39:06,520
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

1860
02:39:06,683 --> 02:39:09,061
Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth

1861
02:39:09,227 --> 02:39:10,570
was nothin' but horseshit.

1862
02:39:10,728 --> 02:39:14,574
But he was right about one thing:
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

1863
02:39:17,402 --> 02:39:19,143
You son of a bitch!

1864
02:39:19,320 --> 02:39:22,062
You motherfucker!

1865
02:39:22,240 --> 02:39:24,527
Oh, sweet Jesus,
let me kill this nigger!

1866
02:39:26,119 --> 02:39:29,089
You ain't gonna get away with this,
Django!

1867
02:39:29,247 --> 02:39:31,238
They gonna catch your black ass.

1868
02:39:31,416 --> 02:39:33,703
You gonna be on the
wanted posters now, nigger.

1869
02:39:33,877 --> 02:39:36,710
The bounty hunters
gonna be lookin' for you.

1870
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:41,124
You can run, nigger,
but they gonna find your ass!

1871
02:39:41,301 --> 02:39:45,215
And when they do, oh, Lord,
what they gonna do to your ass!

1872
02:39:45,388 --> 02:39:48,096
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!

1873
02:39:48,266 --> 02:39:50,007
You done fucked up!

1874
02:39:50,185 --> 02:39:52,279
This Candyland, nigger!

1875
02:39:52,437 --> 02:39:55,145
You can't destroy Candyland!

1876
02:39:55,315 --> 02:39:58,945
We been here!
There's always gonna be a Candyland!

1877
02:40:09,954 --> 02:40:13,504
Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!

1878
02:40:13,666 --> 02:40:16,283
They gonna find your black ass!

1879
02:40:20,840 --> 02:40:23,423
Django!

1880
02:40:23,593 --> 02:40:25,971
You uppity son of a...

1881
02:41:00,755 --> 02:41:02,291
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1882
02:41:02,966 --> 02:41:04,889
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.

1883
02:41:32,203 --> 02:41:36,834
You know what they are going to call
you? "The fastest gun in the South."

1884
02:41:44,465 --> 02:41:46,058
Let's get outta here.

1885
02:45:14,926 --> 02:45:16,462
Who was that nigger?
