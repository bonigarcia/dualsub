Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

2
00:00:04,252 --> 00:00:07,632
All of this, falling apart
is on you!

3
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,231
I can grow your business
exponentially.

4
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:13,992
What do you know about
the Czech Republic?

5
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:15,661
This office needs an ASAC.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,500
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

7
00:00:17,597 --> 00:00:18,657
with you at the helm.

8
00:00:18,755 --> 00:00:20,052
I left something for you.

9
00:00:21,868 --> 00:00:22,850
I'm out.

10
00:00:23,972 --> 00:00:25,017
W.W.

11
00:00:25,218 --> 00:00:26,722
I mean, who do you figure that is?

12
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:28,874
You got me.

13
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:55,424
_

14
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:32,999
Hello, Carol.

00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,159
Oh, my God, Skyler.

17
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,360
Okay, I'll take the pink one.

18
00:06:35,411 --> 00:06:36,978
- It's a princess cupcake.
- Ooh.

19
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:38,413
- Skyler?
- I know, right?

20
00:06:38,447 --> 00:06:40,999
Well, actually,
they were my idea,

21
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:42,500
so you are all welcome.

22
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:44,002
You are the devil.

23
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:49,007
Hey, buddy.
Ready for a cold one?

24
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,293
Nah. I'm not feeling
hundred percent.

25
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:54,095
- Oh, no.
- I hope it's not something you ate.

26
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,964
No, no, I just...

27
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,099
We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

28
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:59,667
Yeah.

29
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:00,685
Uh, no, I'm good.

30
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,804
I-I-I--
We need to shove off.

31
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:04,606
Okay, yeah.
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

32
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,975
I'm sorry, Skyler.
I hate to leave you with--

33
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,194
No, no, don't worry about it.
I have plenty of help.

34
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:12,030
- And by that, she means me.
- That is correct.

35
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:14,616
- Holly can help.
- Let's go say good-bye.

36
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,517
Let's go send them
on their way.

37
00:07:16,535 --> 00:07:18,519
- Let's say good-bye.
- Yes.

38
00:07:18,537 --> 00:07:20,521
- Too long.
- Mwah. Say, "Bye, Auntie."

39
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,323
Bye, sweetie. Bye-bye.

40
00:07:22,357 --> 00:07:25,577
Hey, and you know it's been about a
hundred years since we've been bowling.

41
00:07:25,628 --> 00:07:28,029
- Well, then, how about Thursday night?
- Oh, that sounds great.

42
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:30,364
Oh, thank you for having us.

43
00:07:30,382 --> 00:07:33,367
Hey. You okay to drive?

44
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:35,720
Yeah.

45
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,973
All right.
Well, feel better.

46
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,095
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank."
Bye-bye.

47
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,016
Bye-bye.

48
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,485
Bye, Aunt Marie.
Can you wave bye?

49
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:52,854
All right, let's get started
on those dishes. Come on.

50
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:56,191
- You. - No, you.
- You. Washing, okay?

51
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,660
- I'll dry. You wash.
- Hello, Carol.

52
00:07:58,694 --> 00:08:01,913
Oh, hi, Walt.

53
00:08:01,947 --> 00:08:04,449
Europe.
I can't believe it.

54
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,919
- Were you there when she said that?
- Yeah.

55
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,088
You okay?
Your stomach okay?

56
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:11,405
Yeah, oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

57
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:16,344
Okay.
God. Jesus, Europe.

58
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:19,047
I just-- And, you know,
where they were

59
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,915
three or four months ago.

60
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:22,583
Oh, she was talking about it.

61
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:24,602
It sounds like it's--

62
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,137
We need to go to Europe.

63
00:08:26,188 --> 00:08:27,639
- We could go.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,358
It'd have to be, like,
a business trip, you know.

65
00:08:30,392 --> 00:08:32,393
It could, um--
We could go to Italy.

66
00:08:32,427 --> 00:08:34,779
To, um, Lake Como.

67
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:36,197
It's "Como," right?

68
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:37,932
...Like Mario Cuomo?

69
00:08:46,608 --> 00:08:49,244
Hank. Hank?

70
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,278
Hank?

71
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,580
Baby, you okay?

72
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,249
Hank!

73
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,788
Oh, my God.
Hank!

74
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:04,843
Hank! Hank! Oh, my God!

75
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:08,296
Hank, are you--

76
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,515
- Are you okay? Are you okay?
- I'm good.

77
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:14,185
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

78
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:17,188
Okay. You okay?
Just take a breath.

79
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,023
Oh, God, sweetheart.

80
00:09:19,074 --> 00:09:20,491
It was an accident.
It happens.

81
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:23,027
I'll make the appointment.
All you have to do is show up.

82
00:09:23,078 --> 00:09:26,314
For what? Three hours
in the Emergency Room?

83
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:27,498
All for nothing?

84
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,667
All they did was rule out
a heart attack.

85
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,086
- What if it happens again?
- It's not gonna happen again.

86
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:35,373
How can you know that? You can't even
say what it was in the first place.

87
00:09:35,424 --> 00:09:36,841
Marie, baby, I'm okay.

88
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:40,461
I'm fine. Trust me.
Discussion over.

89
00:09:40,495 --> 00:09:43,131
- And do not tell Skyler.
- What? Why?

90
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,300
Just don't.

91
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,719
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

92
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,769
_

93
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:10,976
_

94
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:12,557
_

95
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:52,667
Hola, Mariano.

96
00:10:52,701 --> 00:10:53,701
Morning.

97
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,736
Luis. Enrique.

98
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,672
Oh, feliz cumpleaños, Enrique.

99
00:10:57,706 --> 00:10:59,674
Hi.

100
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,260
Hi.

101
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:06,464
Here you go.

102
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,582
There's complimentary
coffee inside.

103
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,269
Have an A-1 day.

104
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,471
Air fresheners
are high margin, right?

105
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:15,556
At 30 cents wholesale, yeah.

106
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,609
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display,

107
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:20,945
separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

108
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,533
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

109
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,236
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

110
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,122
So maybe we move that
over to the cash register

111
00:11:31,156 --> 00:11:33,607
by the five-hour
energy drink.

112
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,126
Sure. Fine.

113
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,247
Yeah, yeah.
Come here.

114
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,116
Speaking of the business,

115
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,419
the story comes first.

116
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,838
The story is is that
we are car wash owners,

117
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,172
pure and simple.

118
00:11:48,223 --> 00:11:51,843
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful,

119
00:11:51,894 --> 00:11:55,129
what do successful
car wash owners do?

120
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,299
They buy more car washes.

121
00:11:59,601 --> 00:12:02,770
Listen. Skyler.

122
00:12:02,804 --> 00:12:05,490
We'll be laundering
that money for years.

123
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,492
Decades.

124
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:10,495
Wouldn't two
be better than one?

125
00:12:12,114 --> 00:12:14,532
Well, there's gentle hands
over by Kirtland.

126
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,617
I do love that location.

127
00:12:19,254 --> 00:12:21,039
I'll think about it.

128
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,757
Yeah. Right. Right.

129
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,043
To be continued.

130
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,260
Okay.

131
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,432
Good morning.
Welcome to A-1.

132
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,551
Just the regular, please.

133
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:36,337
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax-- 21.99--

134
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,440
if you're interested in getting
rid of those water spots.

135
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:41,142
Just the regular is fine.

136
00:12:41,176 --> 00:12:45,012
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

137
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,365
Have an A-1 day.

138
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,072
Please give this to
your car wash professional,

139
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:56,374
and have an A-1 day.

140
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:03,864
68%. And falling.

141
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,917
Good morning. May I have
your ticket, please?

142
00:13:05,968 --> 00:13:09,804
I knew there would be
a drop in quality, but 68%?

143
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:13,707
This is not what I agreed to.

144
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:16,394
I left a viable operation.

145
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:18,396
The rest was up to you.

146
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:20,398
May I have your ticket, please?

147
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,483
I'm only asking for a few days.

148
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:25,069
A week at most.
Call it a tutorial.

149
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,221
That's the standard wash.

150
00:13:27,239 --> 00:13:30,575
Fix this.
Get the ship back on course.

151
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,578
We'll make it worth your while.

152
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:37,081
That'll be 14.95, please.

153
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,369
Listen, this is
a complicated situation.

154
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,621
There are a lot
of moving parts.

155
00:13:43,672 --> 00:13:47,175
None of which are my concern.

156
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,129
You're putting me
in a box here.

157
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,347
You know what could happen.

158
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,136
Again, none of my concern.

159
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,770
There's your change.

160
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:02,056
And if you'll hand this
to your car wash professional.

161
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,091
And have an A-1 day.

162
00:14:09,615 --> 00:14:12,200
- Listen--
- It'll only be a few more minutes.

163
00:14:12,234 --> 00:14:14,768
There's some complimentary
coffee, if you like.

164
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,134
What's up?

165
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:32,970
Just wondering
who washes a rental car.

166
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,976
Walt, who was that?

167
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,349
She's a former
business associate

168
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,518
who wants me to go back.

169
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:49,904
And I won't.

170
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,622
Enrique, this one's finished.

171
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:10,208
Terminado. Gracias.

172
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,544
Get out of here.
Now.

173
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:17,682
- Excuse me?
- Never come back here.

174
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:20,301
Do you understand me?

175
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:22,887
- I--
- Go.

176
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:46,579
Hey.
Hey.

177
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,116
Oh, thanks.

178
00:15:50,167 --> 00:15:52,068
Are you going in today?

179
00:15:52,086 --> 00:15:54,871
- Uh, no. Uh-uh.
- Good.

180
00:15:54,905 --> 00:15:57,257
Just, you ow, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

181
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,758
- Yeah.
- Stay home and rest.

182
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,760
- Don't even think about work.
- Okay.

183
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,379
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Bye-bye.

184
00:16:18,262 --> 00:16:19,979
- Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
- Hey, guys.

185
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:22,315
- What's going on?
- Just dropping these off, ma'am.

186
00:16:22,366 --> 00:16:24,867
- Where would you like them?
- Bring them around to the garage, guys.

187
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:28,204
I got it.
Have a good day.

188
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,607
You too.

189
00:16:32,876 --> 00:16:34,777
Boss, Janice said to tell you

190
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,046
a few of them
might not have indexes.

191
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:40,500
- We could give you a hand sorting
through them. - No, I got it. Thanks.

192
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:44,804
All right.

193
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:47,851
- See you, boss.
- Okay.

194
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:51,079

Dude, you are tripping.

219
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:54,168
I'm not dead. I'm on
the starship Enterprise,

220
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:57,922
macking on Yeoman Rand, while the
Andorian with the Disrupter's

221
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:00,224
back on Talos Four or whatever.

222
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:02,727
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

223
00:19:02,728 --> 00:19:04,728
The transporters are breaking
you apart, man.

224
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:06,981
Down to your molecules
and bones.

225
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,599
They're making a copy.

226
00:19:08,651 --> 00:19:11,102
That dude who comes out on the
other side, he's not you.

227
00:19:11,153 --> 00:19:12,987
He's a Color Xerox.

228
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,573
So you're telling me every time
Kirk went into the transport,

229
00:19:15,607 --> 00:19:17,442
he was killing himself?

230
00:19:17,493 --> 00:19:21,395
So over the whole series,
there was, like, 147 Kirks?

231
00:19:21,413 --> 00:19:23,164
At least.

232
00:19:23,198 --> 00:19:27,234
Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy
never likes to beam nowhere?

233
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,236
'Cause he's a doctor, bitch.

234
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:31,906
Look it up.
It's science.

235
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,010
I ever tell you about
my Star Trek script?

236
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:37,912
Star Trek script?

237
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,348
Yeah. I gotta
write it down is all.

238
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:45,753
The Enterprise
is five parsecs out of Rigel 12.

239
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,940
Nothing's going on,
Neutral Zone is quiet,

240
00:19:48,974 --> 00:19:50,558
the crew is bored,

241
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:53,027
so they put on
a pie-eating contest.

242
00:19:53,062 --> 00:19:56,614
- The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies-- - Tulaberry?

243
00:19:56,648 --> 00:19:58,866
Tulaberries.
From Gamma Quadrant, yo.

244
00:19:58,901 --> 00:20:00,601
That's Voyager, dude.

245
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:03,788
Okay, blueberries then.
They're eating blueberry pies

246
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:07,291
as fast as the replicator
can churn them out.

247
00:20:09,912 --> 00:20:11,879
Finally,
it's down to just three--

248
00:20:11,914 --> 00:20:14,382
Kirk, Spock, and Chekov.

249
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:16,634
Okay, Spock always wins
these things.

250
00:20:16,668 --> 00:20:19,220
How is Spock
gonna beat Kirk, yo?

251
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:21,889
Spock's like a toothbrush.
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

252
00:20:21,924 --> 00:20:25,626
Spock has total vulcan control
over his digestion.

253
00:20:25,644 --> 00:20:27,795
- You wanna hear this or not?
- Yeah, yeah, go.

254
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:31,232
Okay, finally, Kirk--
he can't take it anymore.

255
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:35,302
He yorks. Now it's just
down to Chekov and Spock.

256
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,988
But Chekov, you see,

257
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:41,242
he's got a whole fat stack
of Quatloos riding on this,

258
00:20:41,276 --> 00:20:44,245
and he has figured out
a way to win.

259
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:46,531
He's got Scotty back
in the transporter room,

260
00:20:46,582 --> 00:20:48,533
locked in on Chekov's stomach.

261
00:20:48,584 --> 00:20:51,652
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

262
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,254
Where is he sending them?
The toilet?

263
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:54,872
Space.

264
00:20:54,923 --> 00:20:57,175
There's blueberries
just floating out there,

265
00:20:57,209 --> 00:20:59,377
frozen, because it's in space,

266
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:02,764
and Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth,

267
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:05,933
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

268
00:21:05,968 --> 00:21:09,837
Meanwhile, Scotty's in the transporter
room fiddling with levers,

269
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:12,006
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in,

270
00:21:12,024 --> 00:21:14,525
and she's got, you know,
her big pointies.

271
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,528
- And Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.
- No.

272
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:21,682
Chekov screams. He sprays
blood out of his mouth.

273
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,735
Scotty beamed his guts
into space!

274
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:28,022
No way!

275
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,225
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

276
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,211
Just fill this out.
Bring it back to me.

277
00:21:52,598 --> 00:21:53,764
Yo.

278
00:21:55,767 --> 00:21:58,402
Yo!

279
00:22:03,558 --> 00:22:05,392
Ohhh.

280
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:36,524
You know you can't
smoke that up in here.

281
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:46,868
Yeah. Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

282
00:22:46,902 --> 00:22:49,103
Give me a break, man.

283
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:56,610
Pinkman, he'll see you now.

284
00:22:56,628 --> 00:22:59,947
Woody Harrelson,
live and in person.

285
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:01,949
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

286
00:23:01,967 --> 00:23:04,468
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

287
00:23:04,503 --> 00:23:06,787
Uh, sorry to keep you
on ice out there, kid.

288
00:23:06,805 --> 00:23:09,290
If I'd known it was you,
well...

289
00:23:09,308 --> 00:23:11,509
Francesca.
I've warned her before.

290
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,845
One more time,
and it's back to the DMV.

291
00:23:14,897 --> 00:23:19,466
So, uh,
are we on our own today?

292
00:23:19,484 --> 00:23:21,135
Barn door open.

293
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:23,637
"Barn door"?

294
00:23:23,655 --> 00:23:24,989
Oh.

295
00:23:25,023 --> 00:23:27,491
So, uh, how is the maestro?

296
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,493
Things have been quiet
on this end.

297
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:31,195
I haven't seen him.

298
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:34,148
Just as well, probably.

299
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:36,650
That whole thing
in the jails--

300
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:38,452
I mean, when they start
to whack the lawyers,

301
00:23:38,486 --> 00:23:39,921
that's when I draw the line.

302
00:23:39,955 --> 00:23:44,342
This goes to
Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

303
00:23:44,376 --> 00:23:50,298
and that goes
to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp.

304
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:54,468
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

305
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:56,687
It's 2 1/2 million each.

306
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:59,190
A total of five.

307
00:24:00,776 --> 00:24:02,727
Mr. and Mrs., uh, who?

308
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:05,279
Drew Sharp's parents.

309
00:24:05,314 --> 00:24:08,783
Drew Sharp-- that's the kid on TV.
The missing, uh--

310
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:12,153
So but why would you, uh--
Scratch that.

311
00:24:12,187 --> 00:24:14,038
I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

312
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:17,742
Uh, thing is,
what those folks want

313
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:19,410
is to know what happened
to their boy.

314
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,245
Sack full of cash
on their doorstep--

315
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:23,748
that's just gonna
raise more questions.

316
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:27,718
Kaylee Ehrmantraut.
That's Mike's granddaughter?

317
00:24:27,753 --> 00:24:31,205
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

318
00:24:31,223 --> 00:24:33,207
It's your money.
Okay.

319
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:36,002
And you're giving it
to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...

320
00:24:36,003 --> 00:24:37,960
It's what Mike wanted.

321
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:42,650
So you and Mike, uh...

322
00:24:42,684 --> 00:24:44,718
You've been in touch?

323
00:24:49,775 --> 00:24:52,743
So we're just
talking about charity?

324
00:24:52,778 --> 00:24:54,912
Yeah.

325
00:24:54,946 --> 00:24:57,281
Okay, look.
You know, um,

326
00:24:57,332 --> 00:25:00,951
shelling out money to the ex
and her little boy-- I kinda get it.

327
00:25:01,003 --> 00:25:03,170
I mean, kinda. But this--

328
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:04,672
This is a bridge too far.

329
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:06,374
I'm sorry to say, kid,

330
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:10,244
but you're still gonna be
two miracles short of sainthood.

331
00:25:13,515 --> 00:25:16,350
Brass tacks, okay?
My job is to advise.

332
00:25:16,385 --> 00:25:20,221
And my advice is...
Come on, already.

333
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:22,473
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue,

334
00:25:22,524 --> 00:25:24,725
and you better believe
his family's on the radar.

335
00:25:24,759 --> 00:25:26,310
A couple million bucks
shows up,

336
00:25:26,361 --> 00:25:28,312
they're gonna snatch it
tout de suite.

337
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,398
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

338
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,599
What are you
you going for a hat trick?

339
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:34,902
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.
- No, no, no!

340
00:25:34,936 --> 00:25:36,487
I was just--
I was thinking out loud.

341
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:38,989
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

342
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:42,410
Yes, yes, absolutely.
I-- I live to serve.

343
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:47,882
And, kid, you might
wanna think about

344
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:49,834
cleaning up a little,
getting some rest.

345
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:52,286
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

346
00:25:59,627 --> 00:26:03,230
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

347
00:26:04,983 --> 00:26:06,633
Yeah, there's a problem.

348
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:09,470
There's five million of them
here in my office.

349
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:13,524
No. No. Don't.
Just hold onto it.

350
00:26:15,243 --> 00:26:18,312
Yes. Ye--

351
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,114
Yes.

352
00:26:20,148 --> 00:26:22,149
Calm down.

353
00:26:24,002 --> 00:26:25,786
I'll handle it.

354
00:27:24,785 --> 00:27:27,220
Déjà vu, huh?

355
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:30,924
Jesus.

356
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,976
All right, look.

357
00:27:33,978 --> 00:27:36,513
You wanna talk me through this?

358
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:38,898
What you were thinking?

359
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:44,487
What you asked Saul to do?
I mean, come on.

360
00:27:44,522 --> 00:27:46,856
It's just nonsensical.

361
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:58,451
I mean, do you...

362
00:27:59,453 --> 00:28:01,588
You have any explanation
at all?

363
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,160
What?

364
00:28:08,462 --> 00:28:10,880
It's like you said.
It's...

365
00:28:10,931 --> 00:28:13,049
It's blood money.

366
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,768
I s--

367
00:28:17,021 --> 00:28:19,723
Jeez. Okay. Yes. All right.

368
00:28:19,774 --> 00:28:23,226
I said that. I did.

369
00:28:24,895 --> 00:28:27,447
But it was in--
in the heat of the moment.

370
00:28:27,481 --> 00:28:30,450
I was trying to win
an argument, all right?

371
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:34,371
And I was wrong.

372
00:28:34,405 --> 00:28:36,573
This is your money.

373
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:38,958
Come on.
You've earned it.

374
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,881
Drew Sharp.

375
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,569
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

376
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,691
But, son...

377
00:29:12,777 --> 00:29:15,395
you need to stop focusing

378
00:29:15,413 --> 00:29:18,164
on the darkness behind you.

379
00:29:18,199 --> 00:29:20,533
The past is the past.

380
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:28,208
Nothing can change
what we've done.

381
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,178
But now that's over.

382
00:29:33,464 --> 00:29:36,099
You're out,

383
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:38,301
and so am I.

384
00:29:41,055 --> 00:29:43,773
That's right.
I'm done.

385
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,611
I've been out
for about a month.

386
00:29:51,031 --> 00:29:54,150
And there is nothing left
for us to do

387
00:29:54,201 --> 00:29:58,988
except to try to live...

388
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,076
ordinary, decent lives.

389
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:21,060
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

390
00:30:24,482 --> 00:30:26,983
She needs someone
looking after her.

391
00:30:28,986 --> 00:30:31,137
Mike is perfectly capable

392
00:30:31,155 --> 00:30:33,857
of looking after
his own granddaughter.

393
00:30:36,193 --> 00:30:38,978
I don't think so.

394
00:30:38,996 --> 00:30:41,948
I don't think he is capable.

395
00:30:41,982 --> 00:30:45,201
I don't think he's coming back.

396
00:30:45,252 --> 00:30:47,587
What--
what are you saying?

397
00:30:49,957 --> 00:30:52,509
You doing what you did--

398
00:30:52,543 --> 00:30:55,211
offing Mike's guys?

399
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:58,214
If he was out there,

400
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:01,267
you would have to look over your
shoulder for the rest of your life,

401
00:31:01,302 --> 00:31:03,269
and that's not
how you do things.

402
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,271
So I think he's dead,

403
00:31:05,306 --> 00:31:08,892
and I think you know that.

404
00:31:11,195 --> 00:31:13,730
I don't know that.

405
00:31:16,683 --> 00:31:18,368
I don't.

406
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:22,572
Listen to me.

407
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,825
I did not kill Mike.

408
00:31:27,044 --> 00:31:29,362
The last time that I saw him,

409
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,131
he had his bag--
the one that I brought him--

410
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,467
and he got into his car,
and he drove away.

411
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,170
And for all I know,
he is alive and well.

412
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:44,093
And if-- and if
he does come back,

413
00:31:44,144 --> 00:31:47,764
and he doesn't understand
why I had to do what I did...

414
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,818
well, then, that's on me.

415
00:31:55,656 --> 00:31:57,941
Jesse...

416
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,946
I need you to believe this.

417
00:32:06,584 --> 00:32:09,836
It's not true.
It's just not.

418
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:16,709
So he's out there.
He's okay.

419
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:18,578
Yes.

420
00:32:18,596 --> 00:32:20,680
Mike is fine.

421
00:32:20,714 --> 00:32:23,182
Wherever he is.

422
00:32:23,217 --> 00:32:26,936
We both know that
he can take care of himself.

423
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:30,106
And he's certainly capable

424
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,142
to provide for
his own family, okay?

425
00:32:36,597 --> 00:32:38,448
Jesse?

426
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:42,702
I need you to believe me.

427
00:32:47,107 --> 00:32:50,743
Yeah. Like you said.

428
00:32:51,745 --> 00:32:53,746
He's alive.

429
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,950
Yeah.

430
00:32:59,753 --> 00:33:01,888
Mike's alive.

431
00:33:08,345 --> 00:33:10,463
Absolutely.

432
00:33:18,022 --> 00:33:19,939
Well, you've gotta
have a college counselor.

433
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:21,407
Are they bringing in
someone new?

434
00:33:21,442 --> 00:33:22,975
I don't know.

435
00:33:22,993 --> 00:33:24,694
Um, maybe she'll be back.

436
00:33:24,745 --> 00:33:26,913
And what if she's not?
What are you supposed to do?

437
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:29,115
I mean, what's Louis gonna do?

438
00:33:29,149 --> 00:33:31,784
- He's-- he's not worried.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

439
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,671
What's there to worry about?
It's only college, right?

440
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,339
Right.

441
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:38,758
College.
Nothing more important.

442
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,327
Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's
still not feeling well,

443
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,963
so bowling's off
tomorrow night.

444
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:45,298
Really?

445
00:33:45,332 --> 00:33:48,801
Really. So you're spared
a night out with the family.

446
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:51,054
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

447
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,056
I'll be right back.

448
00:33:53,107 --> 00:33:54,941
Um...

449
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,561
so if bowling's off,

450
00:33:58,612 --> 00:34:02,565
can I--
can I get a late curfew?

451
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:14,460
Ah. Ugh.

452
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,978
Are you gonna
turn off the light?

453
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:24,363
Have you seen Leaves Of Grass?

454
00:35:24,398 --> 00:35:26,282
Hmm?

455
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:28,701
My book.
Walt Whitman.

456
00:35:28,736 --> 00:35:30,620
Dark green hardcover?

457
00:35:30,654 --> 00:35:33,072
I didn't even know we had that.

458
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,094
Hmm.

459
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:43,969
You don't think Junior...

460
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,021
You're kidding, right?

461
00:35:47,023 --> 00:35:50,308
Well, it'll show up.

462
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,711
What's wrong with Hank?

463
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:13,882
Mm, it's a stomach bug,
sounds like.

464
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:17,085
He hasn't been to work
all week.

465
00:36:20,139 --> 00:36:22,974
Well, good night.

466
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:26,724
Good night.

467
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:37,053
Mister, can you help me out?

468
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,389
Spare so change?

469
00:38:50,518 --> 00:38:53,353
Hey. Come back.

470
00:38:53,371 --> 00:38:55,872
Yeah. You. Come here.

471
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:57,908
I got something for you.

472
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:04,748
Here.

473
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,583
Take it.

474
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:08,301
Go ahead.

475
00:39:10,221 --> 00:39:12,422
Just take it.

476
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:16,476
Take it.

477
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:22,315
Yeah.

478
00:40:00,754 --> 00:40:02,922
Anything you
want us to tell Steve Gomez?

479
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,608
He says he's worried about you.

480
00:40:04,642 --> 00:40:07,310
Yeah. Tell him
I already got two grandmas.

481
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:12,983
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

482
00:40:15,936 --> 00:40:18,104
- We better hit it.
- Yeah.

483
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:20,407
See ya.

484
00:40:39,343 --> 00:40:41,678
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

485
00:40:41,729 --> 00:40:43,847
- How are you? Good to see you.
- How you doing?

486
00:40:43,898 --> 00:40:46,633
Very good. Yeah. Well, you know.
I can't complain.

487
00:40:46,651 --> 00:40:49,236
Hey, how's your son's arm, by the way?
I was thinking about that.

488
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,154
It's back to 100%.
We're going to District.

489
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:53,189
It's gonna be exciting.
When? This Saturday?

490
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:56,359
This Saturday morning. I think
first pitch is at 10:00 AM, so, uh...

491
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,694
- 10:00.
- Yeah.

492
00:40:57,745 --> 00:40:59,362
Be there.
Should be a big crowd.

493
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,781
Guys, you're still on the clock here!
Let's go!

494
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:02,949
See you, Walt.

495
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:04,284
- See you, Artie.
- See you, Walt.

496
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:05,818
All right, Scott.
Be well.

497
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:12,325
They're good guys, huh?

498
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:13,927
Yeah.

499
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:16,713
- Well, it's good to see you
up and about. - Yeah.

500
00:41:16,764 --> 00:41:18,965
- How you feeling?
- Well, you know,

501
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:22,535
I've been better, but...
I don't know.

502
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:25,271
You--
Did you get to see a doctor?

503
00:41:25,322 --> 00:41:26,940
I mean,
when one of these things

504
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:28,408
lasts more than three days

505
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:30,159
you really should
get that checked.

506
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,161
Yeah, no, I--
I did and I'm fine.

507
00:41:32,196 --> 00:41:35,064
I'm, uh-- I'm what they say
on the upswing, you know?

508
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:37,784
Mm. Good.
Good to hear.

509
00:41:37,835 --> 00:41:39,786
Yeah.

510
00:41:39,837 --> 00:41:42,789
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I--

511
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,460
Well, looks like you have
the work coming to you.

512
00:41:47,511 --> 00:41:50,079
Perks of being the boss, huh?

513
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,131
Yeah, you know...

514
00:41:55,019 --> 00:41:58,087
How's, uh--
how's things at the car wash?

515
00:41:58,105 --> 00:42:00,139
- Good.
- Yeah?

516
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,108
Yeah, really good.

517
00:42:04,361 --> 00:42:06,980
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

518
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,817
- I don't know. Ma-- maybe.
- Yeah, I mean,

519
00:42:10,868 --> 00:42:14,571
no one else got sick, so you
probably shouldn't worry about it.

520
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,995
Well, Skyler will be very happy to
hear that you're feeling better.

521
00:42:22,046 --> 00:42:23,463
Which reminds me.

522
00:42:23,497 --> 00:42:25,548
I better get back to it.

523
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,121
If there's anything I can do...

524
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:40,129
Feel better.

525
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:53,910
You know...

526
00:42:55,279 --> 00:42:56,913
You're gonna laugh,

527
00:42:56,947 --> 00:43:00,199
but I have to ask you
about this.

528
00:43:01,368 --> 00:43:04,671
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

529
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,873
I mean, it looks just like
the GPS tracker

530
00:43:06,924 --> 00:43:09,125
that we used on Gus Fring,
doesn't it?

531
00:43:10,327 --> 00:43:13,046
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us?

532
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:18,101
You wouldn't know anything
about this, would you, Hank?

533
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:37,036
You okay?

534
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:40,740
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

535
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,248
Ugh!

536
00:43:54,638 --> 00:43:56,539
- Hank--
- It was you.

537
00:43:56,557 --> 00:43:59,392
All along, it was you!

538
00:43:59,426 --> 00:44:01,678
You son of a bitch.

539
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:04,347
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

540
00:44:04,381 --> 00:44:06,482
Calm down.

541
00:44:06,517 --> 00:44:09,602
That call I got telling me
Marie was in the hospital...

542
00:44:09,653 --> 00:44:12,221
that wasn't Pinkman.

543
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,223
You had my cell number.

544
00:44:14,241 --> 00:44:17,944
You killed ten witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

545
00:44:17,995 --> 00:44:21,564
- Listen to me--
- You bombed a nursing home.

546
00:44:21,582 --> 00:44:25,034
Heisenberg. Heisenberg!

547
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:27,870
You lying,
two-faced sack of shit.

548
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:29,872
Hank, look,

549
00:44:29,906 --> 00:44:32,408
I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just--

550
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:36,429
I swear to Christ,
I will put you under the jail.

551
00:44:36,463 --> 00:44:38,681
Just take a breath, okay?
Just listen to yourself.

552
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,517
These wild accusations--
they could destroy our family.

553
00:44:41,552 --> 00:44:44,353
- And for what?
- Damn, like you give a shit about family!

554
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:53,446
Hank, my cancer is back.

555
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:56,783
Good.

556
00:44:56,817 --> 00:44:59,118
Rot, you son of a bitch.

557
00:45:00,154 --> 00:45:02,155
I'm sorry you feel that way.

558
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,908
I wanna beat this thing.
I do.

559
00:45:05,942 --> 00:45:09,545
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

560
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:13,800
But the truth is in six months,

561
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,503
you won't have
someone to prosecute.

562
00:45:19,339 --> 00:45:21,257
But even--

563
00:45:21,291 --> 00:45:24,060
even if somehow

564
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:27,764
you were able
to convince anyone

565
00:45:27,798 --> 00:45:30,516
I was capable
of doing these things,

566
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:33,402
you and I both know

567
00:45:33,437 --> 00:45:36,439
I would never see
the inside of a jail cell.

568
00:45:41,478 --> 00:45:45,748
I'm a dying man
who runs a car wash.

569
00:45:45,783 --> 00:45:50,036
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

570
00:45:55,092 --> 00:45:57,627
What's the point?

571
00:46:01,832 --> 00:46:05,218
Have Skyler
bring the kids here,

572
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,770
and then we'll talk.

573
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:14,844
That is not going to happen.

574
00:46:19,983 --> 00:46:22,485
I don't know who you are.

575
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:27,490
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

576
00:46:31,211 --> 00:46:34,413
If that's true,

577
00:46:34,464 --> 00:46:38,033
if you don't know who I am...

578
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,390
then maybe your best course...

579
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:49,428
would be to tread lightly.

580
